There is a tradeoff between generality and speed or peak capability. We see this in biology, and we see this so far in the systems we've built.  Highly specialized systems outperform general systems in narrow domains, but retaining that edge as you generalize proves elusive.
------
I hope someone with more experience than I have with large model training will weigh in and explain some of the challenges. My familiarity is still somewhat limited, and I would prefer someone more comfortable to describe the challenges!
------
You should only get credit for results if you submit working code with data.
------
I think you have to reboot the whole process and have a research program where continuous delivery of replicable results is a requirement—you have to keep your code working (and anything it depends upon) to remain in good standing 

Like a formalization of mathematics

To be honest a more effective way of reducing risk would be to ban 22,000 GPU clusters, not open source (banning math is hard tbh)

I've seen people refer to someone's manifold rank as an indicator of their status as someone whose predictions we should trust.  To the extent they could be capitalizing on community-oriented questions like this, it makes the apparent value of that rank much less convincing.

 Announcing Swift Transformers 

A package to run language models in native apps, on-device.

It's part of a growing set of tools to help Swift developers work with Core ML models. Read on for details, or check our post: https://hf.co/blog/swift-coreml-llm…

4 new tools released today!

Anonymity wins again

We are absolutely facing the dire consequences of posting our likenesses so freely on social media over the last 20 or so years.

After the newness wears off and we reach some kind of new steady state, paying people to post will make the timeline:

This is very exciting, with the caveat that in this context net gain only represents the energy used to power the lasers, not the system as a whole. That's still to come.

I haven't seen reporting yet about how far we still have to go before before the whole system is positive.

Major fusion breakthrough today:

A Lawrence Livermore National Labs fusion experiment achieved an energy net gain today for the second time, producing 3.15 megajoules from an input of 2.05 megajoules from hydrogen atoms. 

The fusion experiment was repeatable.
------
If someone more knowledgable writes this up, please let me know and I'll link it below.
------
Here's some good context:
------
You’re going to need a lot closer to 20,000%, producing the laser pulse took more than 400 MJ

FWIW Lawrence Livermore is not working on fusion energy or trying to make this economical, this is defense research

This video clip where

This is very exciting, with the caveat that in this context net gain only represents the energy used to power the lasers, not the system as a whole. That's still to come.

I haven't seen reporting yet about how far we still have to go before before the whole system is positive.

Major fusion breakthrough today:

A Lawrence Livermore National Labs fusion experiment achieved an energy net gain today for the second time, producing 3.15 megajoules from an input of 2.05 megajoules from hydrogen atoms. 

The fusion experiment was repeatable.

If someone more knowledgable writes this up, please let me know and I'll link it below.

Here's some good context:

You’re going to need a lot closer to 20,000%, producing the laser pulse took more than 400 MJ

FWIW Lawrence Livermore is not working on fusion energy or trying to make this economical, this is defense research

EU thinks it is innovating with its AI regulation, but real innovative regulation would be a section 230 regulation for AI providers, reducing uncertainty for investors, accelerating growth, and ultimately benefitting consumers and patients.

I’d argue the regulatory uncertainty is arguably harming consumers here more than anything else. 

It’s risky for companies to invest in the product category with unclear liability. 

Clarity would accelerate progress and help patients.

In fact, of the two, only ChatGPT listed a disclaimer about potentially outdated info, listed some caveats, and recommended checking with your doctor.

Google surfaced the information in a knowledge box and didn’t contextualize it. You had to click the link for context.

Next to LIMA, this is another interesting paper highlighting that more data is not always better when finetuning LLMs: https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08701

Trimming the orig 52k Alpaca dataset to 9k can improve the performance when finetuning 7B and 13B parameter  LLMs.
------
Oops:
------
The idea that LLMs can't help lay people with medical information is absurd, and holds LLMs to a different standard than other patient-centered resources.

If I search WebMD and it tells me I have either a headache or a brain tumor, have I been harmed? Do I sue someone?
------
Obviously LLMs sometimes share wrong information, but so do your friends and web searches.  The difference is LLMs should be able to help people find better information more quickly more often than the alternatives they actually have access to.  

That's the standard.
------
If measured against the resources lay people actually use, I predict LLMs would already be an improvement over the status quo.

And the important part is that they will be even better tomorrow, and better still the day after that.

Ignoring the value here is peak midwit.
------
When ChatGPT is prompted to answer in JSON and the JSON contains English strings, it seem like the quality of the English in the strings is slightly lower than it's otherwise capable of.

It probably makes sense. Just curious if anyone else has noticed or if I'm imagining it.

EU thinks it is innovating with its AI regulation, but real innovative regulation would be a section 230 regulation for AI providers, reducing uncertainty for investors, accelerating growth, and ultimately benefitting consumers and patients.

I’d argue the regulatory uncertainty is arguably harming consumers here more than anything else. 

It’s risky for companies to invest in the product category with unclear liability.

Next to LIMA, this is another interesting paper highlighting that more data is not always better when finetuning LLMs: https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08701

The idea that LLMs can't help lay people with medical information is absurd, and holds LLMs to a different standard than other patient-centered resources.

If I search WebMD and it tells me I have either a headache or a brain tumor, have I been harmed? Do I sue someone?
------
Obviously LLMs sometimes share wrong information, but so do your friends and web searches.  The difference is LLMs should be able to help people find better information more quickly more often than the alternatives they actually have access to.  

That's the standard.
------
If measured against the resources lay people actually use, I predict LLMs would already be an improvement over the status quo.

And the important part is that they will be even better tomorrow, and better still the day after that.

Ignoring the value here is peak midwit.

okay this paper is wild
transformers *can* be taught arithmetic.
simply reversing the format in which you present the answer, improves accuracy to 100% in ~5k steps (compared to non-convergence by 100k steps).

Humans learn various mental shortcuts for doing math without paper. Similarly transformers find it much easier to learn arithmetic if they can write the answers backwards.

okay this paper is wild
transformers *can* be taught arithmetic.
simply reversing the format in which you present the answer, improves accuracy to 100% in ~5k steps (compared to non-convergence by 100k steps).

Just had the thought that we don’t know Twitter’s rev share compensation formula, and it’s entirely possible they’re paying from a pot that is fixed at a portion of revenue, which is about to get massively diluted with many more participants. 

That would be the funniest outcome.

Have they actually said how they are calculating compensation anywhere that I’ve missed?  If someone made x dollars per month in the last payout, are they expected to be compensated similarly going forward?

Won an award for my paper explaining emergent causal representations, abstraction and how to make a machine that is self aware.

When you try to close the source to your open source project, you had best make sure your initial license allows you to actually do it
------
If the answer is that HF just changed the license it's interesting too. What gives them right to do so except having control of the repository? The Apache 2.0 license Article 5. forbids that saying "without additional terms and conditions."
------
Not really an ideal outcome for anyone, though.
------
Of course they could just stop making their code changes public, and they would be well within their rights to do so.

That's not really an ideal outcome for anyone. Hopefully they can work this out with the contributors, or they might need to reimplement parts of the code.

At this rate, by this time next month we will have a dozen room temperature superconductors
------
We are excited to announce that we have finally been issued our patent for our Above Room Temperature Type II Superconductor. Contrary to some recent reports regarding the paper circulating from Korea. Simply putting "World's First" in your paper title doesn't actually mean you… Show more
------
I'm calling for a six month moratorium on the development of new superconductors while we look for solutions to this problem!
------
in 10 years the challenge will be finding traditional semiconductors
------
Because, to paraphrase Popper, we have a duty to be optimistic. Because the future is open, not predetermined and therefore cannot just be 'accepted': we are all responsible for what it holds. Thus it is our duty to fight for a better world.

I can’t pay for Blue because this is a new account. I’m stuck using a crippled version of Twitter.


@elonmusk
 should let new accounts pay for verification and better service. How do you attract new users when when they can only use the worst version of the website?
------
I’ve been unable to do anything at all on Twitter for the last 4 or 5 hours because it decided I looked like a spam bot. It looks like I’ve finally been allowed to send a message again. 

This is a terrible new user experience. Just let me pay you money to make the pain go away!

A Skills Framework for Training LLMs

- Like how humans acquire skills in deliberate order, LLMs benefit from an order when learning a set of skills

- Leveraging this enables more advanced skills to be learned w/ less data, for pre-training & fine-tuning

This is also the fundamental flaw in centralized alignment strategies.
------
The thesis that one big centralized model can beat millions of local expert models is the same assumption behind why some think Communism (top-down control) can work better than Capitalism (bottom-up emergent self-adaptation).

Fundamentally wrong, as the market will show.

a lack of hope is perhaps the worst of all the modern maladies, and one that e/acc aims to help address.

the future is going to be amazing, and you're going to be here for it. buckle up.

father Gregory Boyle believes gang violence and bad decisions are due “a lethal absence of hope”. I think this is true for depression, except it works both ways, too much hope can lead to disappointment because of unmet expectations, but the lack of it is suffocating

prob not; present risk is near zero. but 1-3 years out is iffier imho

also these examples are only partial failures — it’s made to suck at being evil, whether via pre-train filtering or RLHF brain-damage. it’s a poor indication of e.g. what an evil-tuned model could do

You got a loicense for that construction?
------
That was fast. @elonmusk
------
Haha SF never change

UPDATE: @sfdbi,  which regulates construction in SF, has opened a complaint and is investigating the erection of the X sign.

"A building permit is required to make sure the sign is structurally sound and installed safely," said a DBI spokesman.
