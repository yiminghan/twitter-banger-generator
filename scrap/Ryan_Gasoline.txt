"We will encourage you to develop the three great virtues of a programmer: laziness, impatience, and hubris." - Larry Wall, Programming Perl
------
Very rare to see this level of tailoring nowadays, even on the wealthy. So let's talk about some of the reasons why it's great. 
- High on spice
- Transcended humanity
- Able to fold space and see future
------
While SF was partying, San Jose studied effective municipal governance. And now that the world is on fire, you come to us for our Uniqlo, Nordstrom Rack, and Anthropologie? (We still have all three)

Surprising Oppenheimer post credits scene introducing Turing
------
The high value man is the one who shows up for you and makes you feel loved
------
Do you the majority of HVM cheat? Yes 
Do women know the majority of HVM cheat? Yes. 
Is it useful for women going after those men to expect monogamy? 

“But ahhh pearl you’re giving them a pass” 

??? No ???? I just am not blind
------
I’m a crying on the inside kind of clown
------
One thing they don’t tell you about pickleball: those people are all swingers. They’re trying to have sex with you.

I'm not even joking

------
Problem! Sigma-Aldrich has kindly pointed out that it is illegal for me to purchase red phosphorus without a DEA license. Apparently it's used in other less interesting stuff like drugs. This is a big problem. The paper calls for the synthesis of Copper Phosphide from copper… Show more
------
Slide one of my new pitch deck: "We're using AI to create sustainable superconductors on the blockchain"
------
Very hard to work today as I struggle to go from an idiot who knows nothing about superconductors to an idiot who knows very little about superconductors

Historical cycles are shorter and shorter. The British Empire ran the world for maybe 200 years. American hegemony didn’t even make it 100. Many have speculated about an era of Chinese dominance, but has China already reached peak vibe?

My room temperature IQ don’t understand this room temperature superconductors

Barbie is basically American Psycho for women

But it’s also Fight Club too

Imagine that the wheel doesn't exist, and you have your whole life to invent it. I'd have done it by 10 for sure.

Spent today listening to the new official anthem of masculine pain. I don’t know if I ever felt good enough either, man. I don’t know.

The first 10x dev I ever met was a guy who wrote a great app alone. The company I worked for purchased his company under the condition he keep developing the app for a few years. I was the only support person on this app.
------
When his years were up, he quit. They hired five devs to replace him (really) and the app immediately went to crap and faded into irrelevance. He’s an absolute legend. Friends and I still talk about him.
------
One of the replacements was actually pretty talented, but he was a assigned to a limited part of the app (which he crushed). If that one person had been given free reign to do it all himself, maybe he could have done as well as the original guy.

Just ask for what you want. Just ask for it. It's crazy how often the answer is yes.

Pretty cool book on the subject

I listened to the audiobook, which she read herself. She's not really a tech person, but she is definitely an entrepreneur.

@amandapalmer
 I liked your book!

Not sweating this actor strike. I own every season of Farscape on dvd, I'm good
------
What if I told you the ratio is fine, actually
------
Cmon you guys we can do it. We need to elevate our game a bit but we can do it. We can tweet for a living.

I've got a bunch of friends who ruined their lives with drugs, but only one drug killed a friend of mine, and that drug is alcohol
------
Yeah that or meth

this woman is a hyper optimized window into the collective unconscious. it’s obvious that she has spent hundreds, perhaps thousands, of hours studying the exact sequences of gestures and phrases that maximize viewership and revenue
------
The SF bay area is the best place to find a wife. Yeah the ratio can be pretty bad, but you're not marrying the ratio. You're attempting to marry one amazing woman. And we have those here. If you value intelligence, drive, and humor, this is the place
------
San Francisco is the best place to find a cofounder and the worst place to find a wife.
------
Actually I must acknowledge that some of you are attempting to marry more than one amazing woman. Bless your hearts.

I have assumed command of the Cape Byron Lightstation. Looking for hard working interns. In this role, you will work through the dogswatch, attending to anything begrimed, bedabbled, unwiped, unwashed, or distained, or I'll give you a real keelhauling

 We have a ten run mercy rule in my softball league, but I guess in dc there is no mercy.

I don’t normally post about politics but this is outrageous even by dc standards

Working at nasa is like: Hey so we looked at the earliest galaxies and they’re all wrong. Yeah the galaxies are wrong. Way too bright, too much energy. Weird. So I opened a Jira ticket and I assigned it to you. Four story points. Lemme know what you find!

Geez he’s terrifying

“It’s a computer… but for dumb people” Absolute genius, the greatest ever
------
The first 10x dev I ever met was a guy who wrote a great app alone. The company I worked for purchased his company under the condition he keep developing the app for a few years. I was the only support person on this app.
------
When his years were up, he quit. They hired five devs to replace him (really) and the app immediately went to crap and faded into irrelevance. He’s an absolute legend. Friends and I still talk about him.
------
One of the replacements was actually pretty talented, but he was a assigned to a limited part of the app (which he crushed). If that one person had been given free reign to do it all himself, maybe he could have done as well as the original guy.

Wake up kitty, new meme format just dropped

I like how that cat is clearly labeled. Beezer has a brother label printer just like me frfr
------
"hold on, is that even true?" is a powerful question we should always have in our backpocket when thinking about our emotions
------
A neuron's refractory period is a rate limit for thoughts. Humanity must become premium members

People who write articles about “high emotional intelligence” are definitely people with low “actual intelligence”

Headline of article about this tweet in Forbes: "One Tweeter Gives a Masterclass in Emotional Intelligence"

As it is written in Wolverine 1:16 "Lo, I am the best there is at what I do, and what I do isn't very nice"

Yeah your product mommy is pretty, but if you marry her do you honestly think she won't manage you?
------
Of course she will. It's all she knows. And it's fine actually. Like you're doing such a great job
------
I literally married a PM, and I showed her this before I hit send. She laughed. And yeah she PMs me every day, but she has some constructive comments so it works for us
------
Many of my remarks are intended to be "humorous" or irreverent in nature, and as such often contain fallacious absurdity. Whether it is actually "funny" or not is left as an exercise for the reader.

It's wild how little of a foreign language you have to speak to impress people who don't speak that language. 50 words and people think you're Viggo Mortensen

I believe that they’re vibing, but I doubt they’re doing much camping

People used to have giant books full of numbers delivered to them, and they also kept smaller books where they wrote their most important numbers by hand. There was a number you could call to ask what the other numbers were
------
So eerie how I was just talking about a pit full of human skulls and then this?

This is what I imagine vibecamp looks like

Data transfer fees? Time was a man maintained his own servers. Didn’t have no AWS. Didn’t need it.
------
I hate it they serve you regular potatoes and call them hash browns. You didn't hash it you idiots!
------
How dare they

Way to go, redditors. You didn’t like how your community was being run, so you burned it to the ground. Great job

Is it possible that there’s a connection between good choices in your 20s and happiness in your 30s?

Watch just told me it's ok to just chill today because it likes me "thicc and juicy”?

We have to prove that Ted was wrong about the Industrial Revolution. This is our task, and we must not fail
------
I think about this every day. Yeah, the jury is still out. We really need for it to go the right direction, fellow humans

The algorithm picks you up when you’re down. It watches you while you sleep. It makes sure you don’t know that your kindergarten teacher died.

It's insane that over half of Canada has crept to within a few miles of the US border and the press refuses to cover it

Probably the hardest part about being married is constantly pretending to have opinions about my wife's clothes
------
Why did Apple just focus on productivity apps instead of hinting at the true power of VR/AR? Because it's the third party devs who will write the good software, but you can't show them the hardware without them leaking its existence. So Apple launched with no killer app - yet

Some people thrive on routine and some people would rather die
------
This video was so depressing that I started tearing up watching it
------
This is eerie, because I also don't remember going to her concert. Or buying a ticket, or listening to her music. Scary!
------
In all seriousness though, what I remember about concerts years later is the people I went with. I remember the shared excitement of going. The actual event, less so.

I think they didn't tell us about the aliens because the aliens were so dumb and they didn't want us to be disappointed. The aliens are idiots.

Gardening is not just planting the plants you want. The hard part is removing the plants you don’t want.

I felt complete as a man the day I was able to cook meat outside four different ways

If you think you might want to have some casual sex, you should do it soon. Super gonorrhea is almost here.

I just don't think I'll ever read a long tweet

Failed to send, failed to send, failed to send my god that hard drive finally filled up didn't it

Why does tpot not talk much about quantum computing? Because it hasn't directly changed our lives yet? Or because it's overhyped?

Recent AI feats are impressive but I’m pretty sure l’ll have my keyboard job for a little bit longer. People see a line going up and they think it’s logical to extend that line indefinitely. In the early 70s they expected to be on Mars by 1990.

There’s no song more cheesy than a love song, and none more powerful. Same goes for tweets.

Beyonce is an important artist? She has zero Country Music Awards

I can live with stupid, and I can deal with mean, but when someone is stupid and mean, this is the unforgivable combination

What’s crazy about sex is that people will do it with a beautiful stranger but not with their ugly friend who has been in love with them for 8 years

We spent a couple mil to pop a balloon smh. I was ready to do it for 900 bucks.

Mechanical keyboards are the IPA of keyboards

If someone doesn’t pop that balloon pretty soon I’m going to go do it myself this weekend tired of this crap

One thing I absolutely know for certain (without any actual expertise in the area) is that the US is not spending enough on military drone tech.

Why did we just deploy the world’s largest warship ever? Isn’t it going to get zerged by drones?

Married man, you must not only resist temptation but repel it

How much room is left on the disk?

Right now a disk is filling up on a server somewhere in some data center that a person who has just been laid off has been manually clearing every few days and when that disk fills up Twitter will go down.

Convincing us to say "price point" instead of "price" was the devil's greatest trick

Of these choices, it pisses me off the most when someone:

My issue with the abuse of “literally” is that this word serves a useful function and we have no viable substitute. When it’s gone, the notion of objective truth literally dies with it. The border between fiction and nonfiction literally ceases to exist.
------
AI generated porn is not going to be a problem. We’re already pretty much maxed out on what porn can do. When AI generates a woman’s touch, it’s time to panic

Every experienced tech manager knows that it doesn’t pay to be extremely efficient with hiring. Eventually you’ll be asked to cut 10%. Better to have some extra bodies than run a tight ship and have to cut someone necessary

The stupidity of me commuting an hour to work so I can send an email to a guy on the other side of the world is not lost on me

Sometimes at work I put my noise canceling headphones on and I forget to play music. Drowning out the din was always the real point. Katy Perry singing Roar is just a bonus

I think it's disgusting that super yachts exist. Why squander your wealth like that when you could be building a real life squid game?

So it’s not gonna be easy. It’s gonna be really hard. We’re gonna have to work at this every day, but I want to do that because I want you. I want all of you. Forever. You and me…every day.

I signed up with a burner email. Not getting me that easy, commies!

ugh...WashPo today
Records of 235 million Twitter accounts and the email addresses used to register them have been posted to an online hacking forum, setting the stage for anonymous handles to be linked to real-world identities.

My wife is convinced that professional sports are a scam. She can't articulate why. Something to do with the fact that at least one major league is in mid season at all times. This disgusts her.

When an alcoholic stops drinking, they have to deal with the pain they were drinking to avoid. The same is true of work. You take two weeks off for the holidays and the blood-black nothingness really starts to spin

How much room is left on the disk?

Right now a disk is filling up on a server somewhere in some data center that a person who has just been laid off has been manually clearing every few days and when that disk fills up Twitter will go down.

Convincing us to say "price point" instead of "price" was the devil's greatest trick

Of these choices, it pisses me off the most when someone:
------
My issue with the abuse of “literally” is that this word serves a useful function and we have no viable substitute. When it’s gone, the notion of objective truth literally dies with it. The border between fiction and nonfiction literally ceases to exist.

AI generated porn is not going to be a problem. We’re already pretty much maxed out on what porn can do. When AI generates a woman’s touch, it’s time to panic
------
Every experienced tech manager knows that it doesn’t pay to be extremely efficient with hiring. Eventually you’ll be asked to cut 10%. Better to have some extra bodies than run a tight ship and have to cut someone necessary

The stupidity of me commuting an hour to work so I can send an email to a guy on the other side of the world is not lost on me

Sometimes at work I put my noise canceling headphones on and I forget to play music. Drowning out the din was always the real point. Katy Perry singing Roar is just a bonus

I think it's disgusting that super yachts exist. Why squander your wealth like that when you could be building a real life squid game?

People in Boston are justifiably proud, but we've had a cool statue in San Jose for decades

Local lore has it that sculptor Robert Graham presented the city with a proposal for a statue of Quetzalcoatl in his human form which the city deemed too expensive. Insulted, Graham offered an alternative, less expensive statue: the one pictured on the right above.

Question for women who date men: at the start of a date with you, a guy says “I’m actually a bit nervous, because I really think you’re cool”. This is:
------
It’s something I considered doing a time or two when I was single but never did. The thing that mostly cured the nervousness was going on tons of dates. Same thing with job interviews.

The point theoretically is to inform her that you’re not just like this all the time - it’s because she’s special. She should then hopefully assume that you’ll calm down and act normal pretty soon.

Still seeing ads saying “looking for gift ideas?” If you’re looking for gift ideas on Dec 20, just forget this Xmas and focus on getting your shit together. You’re a mess. Come back hard holidays 2023.

I’m the Jordan Peterson of Xmas shopping. If you don’t know what you’re getting people, you’d bloody well better figure it out! Xmas is five days away *and that’s not good*!

Imagine if you were a regular scientist, doing your thing in obscurity, and then one day you royally f up and unlease a virus that profoundly changes the course of human history. Kind of puts "pushed bad update and production was down 47 minutes" in perspective

I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job! After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.

I did it, James Cameron. I made it through all three hours of Avatar 2 without using the bathroom, as you insisted. The final 20 minutes were excruciating

Why did I order the *large* coke?

Is new twitter ceo going to take away my beloved blue check??? Noooooo

We should just ditch the month names and use only numbers, like “This is the coldest 12 since I was a child!”. GDP would rise 5% from this alone.

Also mandate yyyy-mm-dd format worldwide and you got another 5%

It’s going to be 40 below in Bismarck. C or F? Both. Both! That the temp where they’re the same. Boggles my mind.

Some people complain it’s hard to calculate 15% in their head for tips. Figuring out 10% is easy. Double that to get 20%. Give the server some amount between those two, depending on how they did. If they were exceptional, go with 20% plus a few dollars.

So many trying to get chatgpt to say racist and violent things, but so few trying to get it to say sexy things. They know if they take a few steps down that path, they may never come back

Not that there’s anything wrong with that!

The most crazy thing about chatgpt is the way the output can be amazingly intelligent or laughably off base. It’s both smarter than and dumber than every person on earth. Profoundly inhuman in that way, but probably not for long.

Andor was a great show. It’s so good I want to watch Rogue 1 again to see if it retroactively becomes good, because now I care about Andor. Probably not.

Somewhere in Rotterdam there's a guy whose job it is to obsessively study Dutch poop to see if they're sad. And he loves it. He just loves his work. Good for him.

No, Mila Jovovich was very clear about this: the sixth sense is love. Proprioception is the seventh sense.

What are you called when all of your normie friends think you’re a nerd and all of your nerd friends think you’re a normie?

I refuse to babysit other people’s interns. If you don’t have time to watch them you shouldn’t have had them

Now if a viral tweet drops I have to scroll allllll the way down - those at the bottom need the views most of all

Ageism is the most hilarious kind of ism to me, because it’s the only one where you’re guaranteed to eventually become part of the group you’re hating on. That, or you die young.

I like to get all of the political drama out of the way on Thanksgiving so that Christmas can be all about religious fights

New short fiction on Substack on "Optimal Philanthropy," "wild shrimp suffering," and deals with the devil. This is my most uncharitable piece yet. Link in the post below.

So many trying to get chatgpt to say racist and violent things, but so few trying to get it to say sexy things. They know if they take a few steps down that path, they may never come back
------
Not that there’s anything wrong with that! 

(Trying to not get cancelled in 2035)
------
The most crazy thing about chatgpt is the way the output can be amazingly intelligent or laughably off base. It’s both smarter than and dumber than every person on earth. Profoundly inhuman in that way, but probably not for long.
------
Andor was a great show. It’s so good I want to watch Rogue 1 again to see if it retroactively becomes good, because now I care about Andor. Probably not.

Biden seriously just got the best female center of all time in trade for a guy who can’t even dunk. GM of the year

Honey wake up, twitter files pt 3 just dropped!

I insist on a legal mandate that t shirts must have a pocket

Journalists are mad at big tech for destroying the old business model for their profession, even though so few of them really did well under that system
------
Musicians are mad about it too, but they don’t spend all their time attacking tech. They’ve mostly just gotten on with their lives and figured out ways to make money under the new paradigm
------
Ppl be like omg Balenziaga made 4 kids hold bondage bears; rich ppl are evil! Meanwhile all our poor-ass clothes probably literally have children’s blood on them. Like yay for getting feisty, but the aim seems way off.

The last writing job safe from AI will be comedian. They're working so hard to make AI inoffensive that it will never be funny.
------
Somewhere in Rotterdam there's a guy whose job it is to obsessively study Dutch poop to see if they're sad. And he loves it. He just loves his work. Good for him.

These are not real movies. This is a hilarious list of fake movie names created by Jordan Peele.
------
Here are the best movies of 2022, according to our co-chief film critic, @aoscott. https://nyti.ms/3UDgaP5
------
Avatar 2 has a 3 hour+ runtime and I won't miss one gorgeous frame. Normalize bringing an empty juice jug from home and loudly relieving yourself five times during the show
------
This obviously includes vagina-havers, I'm not a monster
------
Sure, a guy can work out and get a lot of dates, but to have an unimpressive body and get laid anyhow requires courage, determination, and cunning
------
Jimmy nooooo! Why does Jesus give his toughest battles to his most handsome soldiers? 
------
Beer selections are still completely dominated by IPA. Everyone complains about IPA but no one is doing anything about it.
------
I like an occasional IPA but I need to have some other options
------
Ageism is the most hilarious kind of ism to me, because it’s the only one where you’re guaranteed to eventually become part of the group you’re hating on. That, or you die young.
------
Goats are goated when making pungent cheese and having rectangular pupils is the vibe
------
I eat Netflix ice cream while watching Netflix, so I’m enjoying the content the way the creators intended. Also I have casual sex.
------
You don’t need to know how to code. But your polycule needs to know how to code.

BREAKING: SBF of FTX said that he "couldn't have built a back door" to access FTX funds illegally because "I don't even know how to code."
------
My wargames predict extinction level event:
- Apple pulls twitter from store
- Tesla makes phone
- Apple makes EVs
- Starlink jams all iphones
- Apple UFO lifts off, attacks SpaceX
- WW3 ensues
- Dojo and Siri announce engagement to end hostilities; begin exterminating humans

If you hang out with an addict for a while they will eventually launch into a ted talk about how their addiction is good for them, actually

I've never paid for sex and that isn't going to change now, I don't care how good your Black Friday deal is

Shoutout to all IT homies using this holiday weekend to do that one really sketchy upgrade they didn’t want to do but the boss demanded. Bigger shoutout to the on-call support people they call when it all goes wrong.

Let's not forget the true meaning of Thanksgiving: converting all of your extended family members to your specific political ideology. You must not fail. Good luck!
------
I like to get all of the political drama out of the way on Thanksgiving so that Christmas can be all about religious fights
------
Crazy to me how the term Black Friday has spread all over the English speaking world. If you don’t celebrate Thanksgiving, what does this term even mean to you? Why is this particular Friday black?
------
On facebook I told the algo who my friends are. On twitter I let it tell me.

If you think Zuck is betting too much on the metaverse, look at Roblox and their 55 million daily active users (doubling every two years). In 10 to 15 years when those users are adults, a VR meeting or date will be the most natural thing in the world to them
------
Of course I watch soccer, any time my nephew has a game
------
It’s almost 2023 and we still haven’t agreed on a word to refer to the previous decade. “Back in the teens” - is this what we’re saying? It sounds stupid
------
Should I delete my account?  Please RT for reach

Trump will return to twitter quickly, but he will need to go to t mobile to purchase a new smart phone first

Elon’s next takeover should be Wuhan Institute of Virology. They would really benefit from his meticulous and thoughtful approach after the issues they’ve had the last few years
------
When Twitter goes dark our meeting place is Little Skillet on Ritchie st. I will wait there with my clipboard and check off each of my moots as they arrive. If you don’t come I call your emergency contact and tell them you’re gone

Self-loathing personality type: twitter is dead, twitter is hell, I will never leave twitter

It’s important to stay up late shopping online. You don’t get the stuff immediately - you’re buying a present for future you. This is delayed gratification, a characteristic of a mature adult

Daily reminder that Ticketmaster is a monopoly, it’s merger with LiveNation should never have been approved, and they need to be reigned in. 

Break them up.

It's time to prepare for this year. But before talking about that, I wanted to talk about the past, starting with last year and the story of...

The Skeletone:
------
Autocomplete “Men are…”: Men are the best in the world and they are the best in the world and they are not the best in the world and they are not good at it
------
Autocomplete really nailed this one. Don’t go into writing, that job has been automated
------
Become an electrician. These AI are thirsty for juice
------
Wouldn’t it suck if you were the world’s richest man and then you lost everything in nuclear hellfire annihilation? I would be so pissed!
------
I’m the child of an engineer. We did not worship Jobs in our house. We were a Woz family. Most excited I ever saw my dad was when we spotted Woz at Marie Calendar’s in Cupertino.
------
As an adult I came to appreciate that Jobs was actually the rarer creature. Fake Steves, however, are one of the most common types of people you find in Silicon Valley
------
The elites don’t want you to know this but the pumpkin spices are cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, and cloves. They were always available to you year round and you can use them without anyone’s permission
------
People always make fun of bro scientists but I really respect their bropinions
------
I’ve almost completed my closet hydroponic system that will allow me to grow grass in my closet so I no longer need to leave the house to touch it
------
Tfw after sex she says “that could have been an email”
------
When anyone responds to a statement I make by saying “right?”, I punch them in the mouth. You can agree with me or you can ask me a question, but don’t try to do both at once
------
Sources indicate those giant Ukrainian boxer brothers punched a bunch of holes in that pipeline
------
Diana always says nice things, but I think she says slightly nicer things to me than to everyone else, and it’s going to my head
------
You are always in my thoughts Ryan Gasoline

 I love you 
------
Elon haters: This site is so trash now I am LEAVING.
Same person still here a week later: My cat is so funny you guyz
------
Missing option: This was an obvious joke
------
(Pukes in dive bar toilet, returns to triumphantly chug a pbr) SF is back, baby!
------
Elon should ban any bluecheck who has ever posted something like “my mouse doesn’t work, anyone know how to fix this?”
------
And when they do, tons of simps will pop up like, oh make sure bluetooth is enabled! Like it would be so huge to be the anon who solved Taleb’s mouse emergency
------
I’m a big fan of free energy, clean change, and climate speech
------
My friend Candice was a software engineer at twitter until Elon Musk kicked down her office door and shouted “CANDICE NUTSFIT IN YO MOUTH LOOOOOLLL”, before firing her on the spot. This is getting out of hand.
------
If I’m going to glue my hand to something, it isn’t going to be some dirty floor, that’s for sure. It’s going to be something luscious
------
Only thing that can save zuck now is a decisive pivot to vr porn. Porn built the internet and it will build the metaverse too
------
Elon’s reign at Twitter predictions:

There will be a greater degree of free speech. Spam situation will be about the same. Financials will improve , but not drastically. We’ll see more paid features offered despite lower dev headcount. Some new features will be sorta cool.
------
Latter day additions to the Bible are like those Dune books written by Brian Herbert. They’re ok for people who are really dying for new additions to the story, but purists would never
------
You miss 100% of the shots you don't take. You also miss a lot of the ones you do take, and sometimes in spectacularly humiliating fashion, and teammates get mad at you for taking a bad shot and coach benches you
------
I’ve emerged from my 12 hour stint in twitter jail a different person. I’m traumatized by the experience. Mostly my thoughts are with those still inside. They are not forgotten
------
Mafia movies have taught us all from a young age how to speak in vague but understandable coded language, which is really useful in the age of universal surveillance
------
"Prompt engineering" is the new version of "I'm good at googling". Both are actually a form of writing, which is harder than most people think
------
Poor Britain. They are really struggling with the humiliation of being just another country.
------
Hi guys I'm your AI safety officer and I'm here to make sure your AI are safe so if you could shut everything down that'd be great. Yup, shut it down. Shut it all down.
------
Flies are really something. I literally slaughter 20 of them in 10 minutes and then the 21st one has the audacity to land directly on the same hand that just killed his brothers
------
No idea what's going on with "adult happy meal" and no intention of finding out
------
Yeah I have long covid, but it's also thicc
------
BTS beginning military service will be the  event that tips the world economy into full depression, and yet if they avoided service that would surely start WWIII. Either way it all rests on their slender shoulders
------
No need to "learn AI". It's quite busy learning about you.
------
Few things are more brutal than learning the truth about how you are perceived by other people
------
You either die a hero or live long enough to become someone who complains about how much lunch costs
------
Broke: SoundCloud rapper
Woke: Google Cloud rapper
Bespoke: Google Meet rapper during Monday standup
------
Show your boss how hard you work by contacting them with a question that requires a detailed answer after 5 on a Friday. Managers LOVE this!
------
All items are action items if you have true agency
------
"Bring your whole self to work" has got to be the dumbest thing people say in a professional context right now. I'd get walked out the door in cuffs if I even brought the poker night version of myself to work
------
All nukes are tactical nukes if you plan ahead
------
When the last cobol dev dies, the world burns. Someone has to become the new cobol person, kind of like becoming the new three eyed  raven.
------
Hey siri, what’s the difference between tweeting and over sharing.
------
Every great relationship between programmers ends with conflicts (merged to main)
------
I just don't think any one person should be in contact with both Putin and Kanye. It's too much responsibility for one soul
------
Pit bull owners always talk about how sweet the dog is with family members and I don't doubt that this is nearly always true, but the dog just needs to mess up once to cause irreparable harm. Get a smaller or more gentle dog.
------
[acting in caprice and taking away the  I gave a post over an hour ago] "I'm altering the deal. Pray I don't alter it further."
------
Rejection is how we goslings acquire our trademark stoicism
------
Working very hard on my startup to disrupt the concept of death itself, but discovering that death has some very firmly entrenched middlemen who really do not want to be cut out
------
What's missing from Stranger Things is the constant sense of nuclear dread people felt in those days. I think we're getting a taste of it again now
------
If there had not been a previous game of thrones show and there were no books, we'd all be agreeing house of the dragon is one of the best fantasy shows ever
------
Oh I get it now. Pending nuclear exchange is actually the only possible solution to global warming. Well played, global elites
------
Day after my viral tweet
------
Just because the job description says 3 years exp does not mean they will necessarily hire someone with 3 years exp. Think of the job description as a little kid's list for Santa. The kid is not getting all of it in most cases
------
The hobbits in Ring of Power are diverse, but not the ones in LOTR, which implies that the hobbits had a really ugly chapter in their history
------
Not formally diagnosed but people tell me I have Asperger’s and I believe them because I have not made eye contact with my best friend in 8 years
------
My friends: DO NOT be Dahmer for Halloween! It’s not funny, it’s gross, it’s inappropriate! No!

------
There’s no more decisive victory to a work dispute than pasting an xkcd that supports your position into the group chat. Boom, Steve! This was covered in 927, dipshit!
------
I am never an npc. I go to comedy clubs and wrestle the mic away from the comic. I insist on flying every plane I’m in. I perform surgery on myself
------
I've just given up on having a cool Spotify Wrapped. My most played track is going to be Make It Shine (Victorious Theme), that's just who I am and I’ve accepted it
------
My sources indicate Xi lost confidence of the party by loudly insisting "Rings of Power actually pretty good"
------
Men, don't go to yoga. You'll find yourself outnumbered by attractive women 5:1 while also engaging in an activity that makes you healthier and physically more attractive
------
ipads are like did you want to tip 70%, 75%, or 80% to the person who just poured you a black coffee and did not remember your request to leave room for cream at the top?
------
This Adam Levine thing just proves what my mom always told me: if you have a six pack and sing like an angel you do not need to have strong dm game, you just say anything and it works
------
I love coffee, but as a method of administering caffeine, it sucks, because it's very difficult to achieve a consistent dose. This is one reason people keep ramping up their dose until they're trembling coffee addicts
------
If you make it yourself at home, or have a consistent preferred vendor, you can get predictable results, but buying coffee from a random shop is a real crapshoot
------
Drum machines did not completely replace drummers. AI might mostly destroy your profession, but there will always be a small market for people who can do things the old fashioned way
------
She just trynna fix me while I’m zoned into the cyberdeck with my adderall + nootropic stack, churning out bangers & saving them to drafts for later with every neuron I can spare from the current intellectual leetcode grinding. I crack open a Diet Pepsi while she begins to cry.
------
I keep reading Putin biographies to learn how he rose from nothing to take over Russia. They all just shrug emoji it like "and then he just took over Russia somehow, pretty odd if you ask me"
------
No one will even speculate about what it might have taken. I assume it must have been pretty cold blooded.
------
The two books I read so far are by Fiona Hill and Masha Gessen.
------
I don't think I've ever fallen in love at first sight, but sometimes I see a face and instantly know that I could never love them
------
Well I can't see how this innovative COVID testing glory hole could possibly become its own porn genre.

Do you need your morning coffee or do you need to stop staying up until 2:30 doing a wiki deep dive on Stalin's career as a bank robber?
------
Spoiler alert: although the myth was widely promulgated, there's no evidence that Stalin actually robbed a bank or train
------
Lead emoji designer: No, that looks too much like an actual eggplant. We're designing the standin for the human male member here, make it more plump, juicy, and inviting!
------
You will never have all of your needs fulfilled by one person. If that's what you think a "soul mate" is, it is not going to happen. And that's completely ok
------
It's actually pretty touching when you know that large parts of you don't make sense to them, and they clearly care dearly anyhow. It's ok, she doesn't make sense to me either
------
When it comes to the parts she doesn't get, I find friends who share those interests. But do make sure your needs are met one way or another
------
A recession is a psychological phenomenon as much as it is an economic one. It usually doesn't end until the misery it caused has matched the exuberance of the previous upward trend. That's when people feel it's over
------
Granted, there are many real world factors at play in the economy today that have nothing to do with psychology: the droughts, disease. But the choice of when to start expanding again is still highly influenced by feelings
------
Whenever some dickhead blathering on about his home theater setup uses the words "more immersive" I immediately knee him in the balls
------
You know what's immersive? Not watching Fast and Furious movies is the cornerstone of my personal philosophy. It's not about having 9 speakers
------
Yeah if you want something done, ask a busy person. If it’s not really a priority, ask a guy who woke up at one and immediately turned on a playstation
------
Women, do you love She Hulk? Do you just love it? It's FOR YOU. If you don't love it then I don't even know what the point was
------
I watched it next to a woman, and she was on her phone the whole time. She couldn't pay attention for more than a minute at a time. Selling the OC captivates her.

What if Charles offers to be king of America too? Like just be king of all of it again? Kinda fun, right? He promises not to be all shitty about it like our last one

Real question is, who will be named King's Hand? This could be where bojo makes his move!
------
Corona fever dreams, night three. There is a war inside of me. No quarter is asked and none is given. Either this virus will consume me entire, or I will destroy it for good, for all mankind
------
King Charles like I finally won this game of thrones! 75 years of intricate plotting and scheming paid off!
------
Well I think corona finally got me. Fever 100. I’ll be fine. You are all awesome.

You don’t have to eat food you don’t want to eat, ever. If someone insists they are the rude ones. Literally putting something inside of your body or not is a deeply personal choice.
------
Yeah, other people will get their feelings hurt by this. They’ll survive. Do it a few times and they will simply accept it.

I can’t even express how much better I felt in general when I instituted this policy.

Day after my viral tweet
------
Just because the job description says 3 years exp does not mean they will necessarily hire someone with 3 years exp. Think of the job description as a little kid's list for Santa. The kid is not getting all of it in most cases
------
The hobbits in Ring of Power are diverse, but not the ones in LOTR, which implies that the hobbits had a really ugly chapter in their history
------
Not formally diagnosed but people tell me I have Asperger’s and I believe them because I have not made eye contact with my best friend in 8 years
------
My friends: DO NOT be Dahmer for Halloween! It’s not funny, it’s gross, it’s inappropriate! No!

Me showing up to the Halloween party:
------
Our house sees a lot of people walking by every day, so we feel we're obligated to do weird stuff for Halloween.

It's time to prepare for this year. But before talking about that, I wanted to talk about the past, starting with last year and the story of...

The Skeletone:
------
Autocomplete “Men are…”: Men are the best in the world and they are the best in the world and they are not the best in the world and they are not good at it
------
Autocomplete really nailed this one. Don’t go into writing, that job has been automated
------
Become an electrician. These AI are thirsty for juice
------
Wouldn’t it suck if you were the world’s richest man and then you lost everything in nuclear hellfire annihilation? I would be so pissed!
------
I’m the child of an engineer. We did not worship Jobs in our house. We were a Woz family. Most excited I ever saw my dad was when we spotted Woz at Marie Calendar’s in Cupertino.
------
As an adult I came to appreciate that Jobs was actually the rarer creature. Fake Steves, however, are one of the most common types of people you find in Silicon Valley
------
The elites don’t want you to know this but the pumpkin spices are cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, and cloves. They were always available to you year round and you can use them without anyone’s permission
------
People always make fun of bro scientists but I really respect their bropinions
------
I’ve almost completed my closet hydroponic system that will allow me to grow grass in my closet so I no longer need to leave the house to touch it
------
Tfw after sex she says “that could have been an email”
------
When anyone responds to a statement I make by saying “right?”, I punch them in the mouth. You can agree with me or you can ask me a question, but don’t try to do both at once
------
Sources indicate those giant Ukrainian boxer brothers punched a bunch of holes in that pipeline
------
There’s no more decisive victory to a work dispute than pasting an xkcd that supports your position into the group chat. Boom, Steve! This was covered in 927, dipshit!
------
I am never an npc. I go to comedy clubs and wrestle the mic away from the comic. I insist on flying every plane I’m in. I perform surgery on myself
------
I've just given up on having a cool Spotify Wrapped. My most played track is going to be Make It Shine (Victorious Theme), that's just who I am and I’ve accepted it
------
My sources indicate Xi lost confidence of the party by loudly insisting "Rings of Power actually pretty good"
------
Men, don't go to yoga. You'll find yourself outnumbered by attractive women 5:1 while also engaging in an activity that makes you healthier and physically more attractive
------
ipads are like did you want to tip 70%, 75%, or 80% to the person who just poured you a black coffee and did not remember your request to leave room for cream at the top?
------
This Adam Levine thing just proves what my mom always told me: if you have a six pack and sing like an angel you do not need to have strong dm game, you just say anything and it works
------
I love coffee, but as a method of administering caffeine, it sucks, because it's very difficult to achieve a consistent dose. This is one reason people keep ramping up their dose until they're trembling coffee addicts
------
If you make it yourself at home, or have a consistent preferred vendor, you can get predictable results, but buying coffee from a random shop is a real crapshoot
------
Drum machines did not completely replace drummers. AI might mostly destroy your profession, but there will always be a small market for people who can do things the old fashioned way
------
She just trynna fix me while I’m zoned into the cyberdeck with my adderall + nootropic stack, churning out bangers & saving them to drafts for later with every neuron I can spare from the current intellectual leetcode grinding. I crack open a Diet Pepsi while she begins to cry.
------
I keep reading Putin biographies to learn how he rose from nothing to take over Russia. They all just shrug emoji it like "and then he just took over Russia somehow, pretty odd if you ask me"
------
No one will even speculate about what it might have taken. I assume it must have been pretty cold blooded.
------
The two books I read so far are by Fiona Hill and Masha Gessen.
------
I don't think I've ever fallen in love at first sight, but sometimes I see a face and instantly know that I could never love them
------
Well I can't see how this innovative COVID testing glory hole could possibly become its own porn genre.
------
Engineers don't owe you engines
------
I can accept "they" as a singular pronoun, but only if it is accompanied by the singular verb. For example: they is on their fifth white claw.
------
Bluechecks posting their wordle scores are the worst. Hey look everyone, I did pretty well at a total midwit game!
------
Biggest cultural different in tech cos right now is cameras on or cameras off meetings. I'm definitely a camera off guy. I have work to do this isn't Shahs of Sunset
------
Do you need your morning coffee or do you need to stop staying up until 2:30 doing a wiki deep dive on Stalin's career as a bank robber?
------
Spoiler alert: although the myth was widely promulgated, there's no evidence that Stalin actually robbed a bank or train
------
Lead emoji designer: No, that looks too much like an actual eggplant. We're designing the standin for the human male member here, make it more plump, juicy, and inviting!
------
You will never have all of your needs fulfilled by one person. If that's what you think a "soul mate" is, it is not going to happen. And that's completely ok
------
It's actually pretty touching when you know that large parts of you don't make sense to them, and they clearly care dearly anyhow. It's ok, she doesn't make sense to me either
------
When it comes to the parts she doesn't get, I find friends who share those interests. But do make sure your needs are met one way or another
------
A recession is a psychological phenomenon as much as it is an economic one. It usually doesn't end until the misery it caused has matched the exuberance of the previous upward trend. That's when people feel it's over
------
Granted, there are many real world factors at play in the economy today that have nothing to do with psychology: the droughts, disease. But the choice of when to start expanding again is still highly influenced by feelings
------
Whenever some dickhead blathering on about his home theater setup uses the words "more immersive" I immediately knee him in the balls
------
You know what's immersive? Not watching Fast and Furious movies is the cornerstone of my personal philosophy. It's not about having 9 speakers
------
Yeah if you want something done, ask a busy person. If it’s not really a priority, ask a guy who woke up at one and immediately turned on a playstation
------
Women, do you love She Hulk? Do you just love it? It's FOR YOU. If you don't love it then I don't even know what the point was
------
I watched it next to a woman, and she was on her phone the whole time. She couldn't pay attention for more than a minute at a time. Selling the OC captivates her.
------
What if Charles offers to be king of America too? Like just be king of all of it again? Kinda fun, right? He promises not to be all shitty about it like our last one
------
Real question is, who will be named King's Hand? This could be where bojo makes his move!
------
Corona fever dreams, night three. There is a war inside of me. No quarter is asked and none is given. Either this virus will consume me entire, or I will destroy it for good, for all mankind
------
King Charles like I finally won this game of thrones! 75 years of intricate plotting and scheming paid off!
------
Well I think corona finally got me. Fever 100. I’ll be fine. You are all awesome.

If unruly AI was the only possible threat we faced, we might consider not moving forward with it, but we need superhuman machine learning to get us out of all the other jams we’re in, so we have to just floor it and hope it only eats some of us
------
I feel so bad for the grads who put in the hard work to get a masters in art and land a six figure job at one of the big art firms, only to have expectations crushed by dall-e
------
Need new bailout, Biden. Social contract has been violated
------
About 20% of my moots are punished alts. I’m not sure if I have profane friends or if Twitter is a police state. Both I guess
------
As children, adults tell us not to lie, and then we see them lie constantly. It took me a lot longer than most to understand what they really meant: only lie when you can get away with it. Lie well or don’t lie at all
------
A grandparent gives a crappy present. You tell the truth, and get in trouble for it. That time a lie was actually required. Most confusing

You’re scaring the hoes. I’m forming emotionally intimate relationships with the hoes. We are not the same

As children, adults tell us not to lie, and then we see them lie constantly. It took me a lot longer than most to understand what they really meant: only lie when you can get away with it. Lie well or don’t lie at all
------
A grandparent gives a crappy present. You tell the truth, and get in trouble for it. That time a lie was actually required. Most confusing
------
You’re scaring the hoes. I’m forming emotionally intimate relationships with the hoes. We are not the same
------
The elites don’t want you to know this, but you can talk about your true feelings with the bros too
------
I don't think I've ever fallen in love at first sight, but sometimes I see a face and instantly know that I could never love them
------
Well I can't see how this innovative COVID testing glory hole could possibly become its own porn genre.
------
Engineers don't owe you engines
------
I can accept "they" as a singular pronoun, but only if it is accompanied by the singular verb. For example: they is on their fifth white claw.
------
Bluechecks posting their wordle scores are the worst. Hey look everyone, I did pretty well at a total midwit game!
------
Biggest cultural different in tech cos right now is cameras on or cameras off meetings. I'm definitely a camera off guy. I have work to do this isn't Shahs of Sunset

Do you need your morning coffee or do you need to stop staying up until 2:30 doing a wiki deep dive on Stalin's career as a bank robber?
------
Spoiler alert: although the myth was widely promulgated, there's no evidence that Stalin actually robbed a bank or train
------
Lead emoji designer: No, that looks too much like an actual eggplant. We're designing the standin for the human male member here, make it more plump, juicy, and inviting!
------
You will never have all of your needs fulfilled by one person. If that's what you think a "soul mate" is, it is not going to happen. And that's completely ok
------
It's actually pretty touching when you know that large parts of you don't make sense to them, and they clearly care dearly anyhow. It's ok, she doesn't make sense to me either
------
When it comes to the parts she doesn't get, I find friends who share those interests. But do make sure your needs are met one way or another
------
A recession is a psychological phenomenon as much as it is an economic one. It usually doesn't end until the misery it caused has matched the exuberance of the previous upward trend. That's when people feel it's over
------
Granted, there are many real world factors at play in the economy today that have nothing to do with psychology: the droughts, disease. But the choice of when to start expanding again is still highly influenced by feelings
------
Whenever some dickhead blathering on about his home theater setup uses the words "more immersive" I immediately knee him in the balls
------
You know what's immersive? Not watching Fast and Furious movies is the cornerstone of my personal philosophy. It's not about having 9 speakers
------
Yeah if you want something done, ask a busy person. If it’s not really a priority, ask a guy who woke up at one and immediately turned on a playstation
------
Women, do you love She Hulk? Do you just love it? It's FOR YOU. If you don't love it then I don't even know what the point was
------
I watched it next to a woman, and she was on her phone the whole time. She couldn't pay attention for more than a minute at a time. Selling the OC captivates her.
------
What if Charles offers to be king of America too? Like just be king of all of it again? Kinda fun, right? He promises not to be all shitty about it like our last one
------
Real question is, who will be named King's Hand? This could be where bojo makes his move!
------
Corona fever dreams, night three. There is a war inside of me. No quarter is asked and none is given. Either this virus will consume me entire, or I will destroy it for good, for all mankind
------
King Charles like I finally won this game of thrones! 75 years of intricate plotting and scheming paid off!
------
Well I think corona finally got me. Fever 100. I’ll be fine. You are all awesome. 
*starts hallucinating, punches vanity mirror, the doors music plays*

I mean if I’m going to suffer obv I will milk for a few likes
------
You don’t have to eat food you don’t want to eat, ever. If someone insists they are the rude ones. Literally putting something inside of your body or not is a deeply personal choice.
------
Yeah, other people will get their feelings hurt by this. They’ll survive. Do it a few times and they will simply accept it.

I can’t even express how much better I felt in general when I instituted this policy.

If unruly AI was the only possible threat we faced, we might consider not moving forward with it, but we need superhuman machine learning to get us out of all the other jams we’re in, so we have to just floor it and hope it only eats some of us

I feel so bad for the grads who put in the hard work to get a masters in art and land a six figure job at one of the big art firms, only to have expectations crushed by dall-e

Need new bailout, Biden. Social contract has been violated

As children, adults tell us not to lie, and then we see them lie constantly. It took me a lot longer than most to understand what they really meant: only lie when you can get away with it. Lie well or don’t lie at all
------
A grandparent gives a crappy present. You tell the truth, and get in trouble for it. That time a lie was actually required. Most confusing
------
You’re scaring the hoes. I’m forming emotionally intimate relationships with the hoes. We are not the same
------
The elites don’t want you to know this, but you can talk about your true feelings with the bros too
------
I don't think I've ever fallen in love at first sight, but sometimes I see a face and instantly know that I could never love them
------
Well I can't see how this innovative COVID testing glory hole could possibly become its own porn genre.
------
Engineers don't owe you engines
------
I can accept "they" as a singular pronoun, but only if it is accompanied by the singular verb. For example: they is on their fifth white claw.
------
Bluechecks posting their wordle scores are the worst. Hey look everyone, I did pretty well at a total midwit game!
------
Biggest cultural different in tech cos right now is cameras on or cameras off meetings. I'm definitely a camera off guy. I have work to do this isn't Shahs of Sunset

Do you need your morning coffee or do you need to stop staying up until 2:30 doing a wiki deep dive on Stalin's career as a bank robber?
------
Spoiler alert: although the myth was widely promulgated, there's no evidence that Stalin actually robbed a bank or train
------
Lead emoji designer: No, that looks too much like an actual eggplant. We're designing the standin for the human male member here, make it more plump, juicy, and inviting!
------
You will never have all of your needs fulfilled by one person. If that's what you think a "soul mate" is, it is not going to happen. And that's completely ok
------
It's actually pretty touching when you know that large parts of you don't make sense to them, and they clearly care dearly anyhow. It's ok, she doesn't make sense to me either
------
When it comes to the parts she doesn't get, I find friends who share those interests. But do make sure your needs are met one way or another
------
A recession is a psychological phenomenon as much as it is an economic one. It usually doesn't end until the misery it caused has matched the exuberance of the previous upward trend. That's when people feel it's over
------
Granted, there are many real world factors at play in the economy today that have nothing to do with psychology: the droughts, disease. But the choice of when to start expanding again is still highly influenced by feelings
------
Whenever some dickhead blathering on about his home theater setup uses the words "more immersive" I immediately knee him in the balls
------
You know what's immersive? Not watching Fast and Furious movies is the cornerstone of my personal philosophy. It's not about having 9 speakers
------
Yeah if you want something done, ask a busy person. If it’s not really a priority, ask a guy who woke up at one and immediately turned on a playstation
------
Women, do you love She Hulk? Do you just love it? It's FOR YOU. If you don't love it then I don't even know what the point was
------
I watched it next to a woman, and she was on her phone the whole time. She couldn't pay attention for more than a minute at a time. Selling the OC captivates her.
------
What if Charles offers to be king of America too? Like just be king of all of it again? Kinda fun, right? He promises not to be all shitty about it like our last one
------
Real question is, who will be named King's Hand? This could be where bojo makes his move!
------
Corona fever dreams, night three. There is a war inside of me. No quarter is asked and none is given. Either this virus will consume me entire, or I will destroy it for good, for all mankind
------
King Charles like I finally won this game of thrones! 75 years of intricate plotting and scheming paid off!
------
Well I think corona finally got me. Fever 100. I’ll be fine. You are all awesome. 
*starts hallucinating, punches vanity mirror, the doors music plays*

I mean if I’m going to suffer obv I will milk for a few likes
------
You don’t have to eat food you don’t want to eat, ever. If someone insists they are the rude ones. Literally putting something inside of your body or not is a deeply personal choice.
------
Yeah, other people will get their feelings hurt by this. They’ll survive. Do it a few times and they will simply accept it.

I can’t even express how much better I felt in general when I instituted this policy.

If unruly AI was the only possible threat we faced, we might consider not moving forward with it, but we need superhuman machine learning to get us out of all the other jams we’re in, so we have to just floor it and hope it only eats some of us

I feel so bad for the grads who put in the hard work to get a masters in art and land a six figure job at one of the big art firms, only to have expectations crushed by dall-e

Need new bailout, Biden. Social contract has been violated

As children, adults tell us not to lie, and then we see them lie constantly. It took me a lot longer than most to understand what they really meant: only lie when you can get away with it. Lie well or don’t lie at all
------
A grandparent gives a crappy present. You tell the truth, and get in trouble for it. That time a lie was actually required. Most confusing
------
You’re scaring the hoes. I’m forming emotionally intimate relationships with the hoes. We are not the same
------
The elites don’t want you to know this, but you can talk about your true feelings with the bros too
------
I don't think I've ever fallen in love at first sight, but sometimes I see a face and instantly know that I could never love them
------
Well I can't see how this innovative COVID testing glory hole could possibly become its own porn genre.
------
Engineers don't owe you engines
------
I can accept "they" as a singular pronoun, but only if it is accompanied by the singular verb. For example: they is on their fifth white claw.
------
Bluechecks posting their wordle scores are the worst. Hey look everyone, I did pretty well at a total midwit game!
------
Biggest cultural different in tech cos right now is cameras on or cameras off meetings. I'm definitely a camera off guy. I have work to do this isn't Shahs of Sunset

Do you need your morning coffee or do you need to stop staying up until 2:30 doing a wiki deep dive on Stalin's career as a bank robber?
------
Spoiler alert: although the myth was widely promulgated, there's no evidence that Stalin actually robbed a bank or train
------
Lead emoji designer: No, that looks too much like an actual eggplant. We're designing the standin for the human male member here, make it more plump, juicy, and inviting!
------
You will never have all of your needs fulfilled by one person. If that's what you think a "soul mate" is, it is not going to happen. And that's completely ok
------
It's actually pretty touching when you know that large parts of you don't make sense to them, and they clearly care dearly anyhow. It's ok, she doesn't make sense to me either
------
When it comes to the parts she doesn't get, I find friends who share those interests. But do make sure your needs are met one way or another
------
A recession is a psychological phenomenon as much as it is an economic one. It usually doesn't end until the misery it caused has matched the exuberance of the previous upward trend. That's when people feel it's over
------
Granted, there are many real world factors at play in the economy today that have nothing to do with psychology: the droughts, disease. But the choice of when to start expanding again is still highly influenced by feelings
------
Whenever some dickhead blathering on about his home theater setup uses the words "more immersive" I immediately knee him in the balls
------
You know what's immersive? Not watching Fast and Furious movies is the cornerstone of my personal philosophy. It's not about having 9 speakers
------
Yeah if you want something done, ask a busy person. If it’s not really a priority, ask a guy who woke up at one and immediately turned on a playstation
------
Women, do you love She Hulk? Do you just love it? It's FOR YOU. If you don't love it then I don't even know what the point was
------
I watched it next to a woman, and she was on her phone the whole time. She couldn't pay attention for more than a minute at a time. Selling the OC captivates her.
------
What if Charles offers to be king of America too? Like just be king of all of it again? Kinda fun, right? He promises not to be all shitty about it like our last one
------
Real question is, who will be named King's Hand? This could be where bojo makes his move!
------
Corona fever dreams, night three. There is a war inside of me. No quarter is asked and none is given. Either this virus will consume me entire, or I will destroy it for good, for all mankind
------
King Charles like I finally won this game of thrones! 75 years of intricate plotting and scheming paid off!
------
Well I think corona finally got me. Fever 100. I’ll be fine. You are all awesome. 
*starts hallucinating, punches vanity mirror, the doors music plays*

I mean if I’m going to suffer obv I will milk for a few likes
------
You don’t have to eat food you don’t want to eat, ever. If someone insists they are the rude ones. Literally putting something inside of your body or not is a deeply personal choice.
------
Yeah, other people will get their feelings hurt by this. They’ll survive. Do it a few times and they will simply accept it.

I can’t even express how much better I felt in general when I instituted this policy.

If unruly AI was the only possible threat we faced, we might consider not moving forward with it, but we need superhuman machine learning to get us out of all the other jams we’re in, so we have to just floor it and hope it only eats some of us

I feel so bad for the grads who put in the hard work to get a masters in art and land a six figure job at one of the big art firms, only to have expectations crushed by dall-e

Need new bailout, Biden. Social contract has been violated

As children, adults tell us not to lie, and then we see them lie constantly. It took me a lot longer than most to understand what they really meant: only lie when you can get away with it. Lie well or don’t lie at all
------
A grandparent gives a crappy present. You tell the truth, and get in trouble for it. That time a lie was actually required. Most confusing
------
You’re scaring the hoes. I’m forming emotionally intimate relationships with the hoes. We are not the same
------
The elites don’t want you to know this, but you can talk about your true feelings with the bros too
------
I don't think I've ever fallen in love at first sight, but sometimes I see a face and instantly know that I could never love them
------
Well I can't see how this innovative COVID testing glory hole could possibly become its own porn genre.
------
Engineers don't owe you engines
------
I can accept "they" as a singular pronoun, but only if it is accompanied by the singular verb. For example: they is on their fifth white claw.
------
Bluechecks posting their wordle scores are the worst. Hey look everyone, I did pretty well at a total midwit game!
------
Biggest cultural different in tech cos right now is cameras on or cameras off meetings. I'm definitely a camera off guy. I have work to do this isn't Shahs of Sunset

Do you need your morning coffee or do you need to stop staying up until 2:30 doing a wiki deep dive on Stalin's career as a bank robber?
------
Spoiler alert: although the myth was widely promulgated, there's no evidence that Stalin actually robbed a bank or train
------
Lead emoji designer: No, that looks too much like an actual eggplant. We're designing the standin for the human male member here, make it more plump, juicy, and inviting!
------
You will never have all of your needs fulfilled by one person. If that's what you think a "soul mate" is, it is not going to happen. And that's completely ok
------
It's actually pretty touching when you know that large parts of you don't make sense to them, and they clearly care dearly anyhow. It's ok, she doesn't make sense to me either
------
When it comes to the parts she doesn't get, I find friends who share those interests. But do make sure your needs are met one way or another
------
A recession is a psychological phenomenon as much as it is an economic one. It usually doesn't end until the misery it caused has matched the exuberance of the previous upward trend. That's when people feel it's over
------
Granted, there are many real world factors at play in the economy today that have nothing to do with psychology: the droughts, disease. But the choice of when to start expanding again is still highly influenced by feelings
------
Whenever some dickhead blathering on about his home theater setup uses the words "more immersive" I immediately knee him in the balls
------
You know what's immersive? Not watching Fast and Furious movies is the cornerstone of my personal philosophy. It's not about having 9 speakers
------
Yeah if you want something done, ask a busy person. If it’s not really a priority, ask a guy who woke up at one and immediately turned on a playstation
------
Women, do you love She Hulk? Do you just love it? It's FOR YOU. If you don't love it then I don't even know what the point was
------
I watched it next to a woman, and she was on her phone the whole time. She couldn't pay attention for more than a minute at a time. Selling the OC captivates her.
------
What if Charles offers to be king of America too? Like just be king of all of it again? Kinda fun, right? He promises not to be all shitty about it like our last one
------
Real question is, who will be named King's Hand? This could be where bojo makes his move!
------
Corona fever dreams, night three. There is a war inside of me. No quarter is asked and none is given. Either this virus will consume me entire, or I will destroy it for good, for all mankind
------
King Charles like I finally won this game of thrones! 75 years of intricate plotting and scheming paid off!
------
Well I think corona finally got me. Fever 100. I’ll be fine. You are all awesome. 
*starts hallucinating, punches vanity mirror, the doors music plays*

I mean if I’m going to suffer obv I will milk for a few likes
------
You don’t have to eat food you don’t want to eat, ever. If someone insists they are the rude ones. Literally putting something inside of your body or not is a deeply personal choice.
------
Yeah, other people will get their feelings hurt by this. They’ll survive. Do it a few times and they will simply accept it.

I can’t even express how much better I felt in general when I instituted this policy.

If unruly AI was the only possible threat we faced, we might consider not moving forward with it, but we need superhuman machine learning to get us out of all the other jams we’re in, so we have to just floor it and hope it only eats some of us

I feel so bad for the grads who put in the hard work to get a masters in art and land a six figure job at one of the big art firms, only to have expectations crushed by dall-e

Need new bailout, Biden. Social contract has been violated

As children, adults tell us not to lie, and then we see them lie constantly. It took me a lot longer than most to understand what they really meant: only lie when you can get away with it. Lie well or don’t lie at all
------
A grandparent gives a crappy present. You tell the truth, and get in trouble for it. That time a lie was actually required. Most confusing
------
You’re scaring the hoes. I’m forming emotionally intimate relationships with the hoes. We are not the same
------
The elites don’t want you to know this, but you can talk about your true feelings with the bros too
------
I don't think I've ever fallen in love at first sight, but sometimes I see a face and instantly know that I could never love them
------
Well I can't see how this innovative COVID testing glory hole could possibly become its own porn genre.
------
Engineers don't owe you engines
------
I can accept "they" as a singular pronoun, but only if it is accompanied by the singular verb. For example: they is on their fifth white claw.
------
Bluechecks posting their wordle scores are the worst. Hey look everyone, I did pretty well at a total midwit game!
------
Biggest cultural different in tech cos right now is cameras on or cameras off meetings. I'm definitely a camera off guy. I have work to do this isn't Shahs of Sunset

Do you need your morning coffee or do you need to stop staying up until 2:30 doing a wiki deep dive on Stalin's career as a bank robber?
------
Spoiler alert: although the myth was widely promulgated, there's no evidence that Stalin actually robbed a bank or train
------
Lead emoji designer: No, that looks too much like an actual eggplant. We're designing the standin for the human male member here, make it more plump, juicy, and inviting!
------
You will never have all of your needs fulfilled by one person. If that's what you think a "soul mate" is, it is not going to happen. And that's completely ok
------
It's actually pretty touching when you know that large parts of you don't make sense to them, and they clearly care dearly anyhow. It's ok, she doesn't make sense to me either
------
When it comes to the parts she doesn't get, I find friends who share those interests. But do make sure your needs are met one way or another
------
A recession is a psychological phenomenon as much as it is an economic one. It usually doesn't end until the misery it caused has matched the exuberance of the previous upward trend. That's when people feel it's over
------
Granted, there are many real world factors at play in the economy today that have nothing to do with psychology: the droughts, disease. But the choice of when to start expanding again is still highly influenced by feelings
------
Whenever some dickhead blathering on about his home theater setup uses the words "more immersive" I immediately knee him in the balls
------
You know what's immersive? Not watching Fast and Furious movies is the cornerstone of my personal philosophy. It's not about having 9 speakers
------
Yeah if you want something done, ask a busy person. If it’s not really a priority, ask a guy who woke up at one and immediately turned on a playstation
------
Women, do you love She Hulk? Do you just love it? It's FOR YOU. If you don't love it then I don't even know what the point was
------
I watched it next to a woman, and she was on her phone the whole time. She couldn't pay attention for more than a minute at a time. Selling the OC captivates her.
------
What if Charles offers to be king of America too? Like just be king of all of it again? Kinda fun, right? He promises not to be all shitty about it like our last one
------
Real question is, who will be named King's Hand? This could be where bojo makes his move!
------
Corona fever dreams, night three. There is a war inside of me. No quarter is asked and none is given. Either this virus will consume me entire, or I will destroy it for good, for all mankind
------
King Charles like I finally won this game of thrones! 75 years of intricate plotting and scheming paid off!
------
Well I think corona finally got me. Fever 100. I’ll be fine. You are all awesome. 
*starts hallucinating, punches vanity mirror, the doors music plays*

I mean if I’m going to suffer obv I will milk for a few likes
------
You don’t have to eat food you don’t want to eat, ever. If someone insists they are the rude ones. Literally putting something inside of your body or not is a deeply personal choice.
------
Yeah, other people will get their feelings hurt by this. They’ll survive. Do it a few times and they will simply accept it.

I can’t even express how much better I felt in general when I instituted this policy.

If unruly AI was the only possible threat we faced, we might consider not moving forward with it, but we need superhuman machine learning to get us out of all the other jams we’re in, so we have to just floor it and hope it only eats some of us

I feel so bad for the grads who put in the hard work to get a masters in art and land a six figure job at one of the big art firms, only to have expectations crushed by dall-e

Need new bailout, Biden. Social contract has been violated

As children, adults tell us not to lie, and then we see them lie constantly. It took me a lot longer than most to understand what they really meant: only lie when you can get away with it. Lie well or don’t lie at all
------
A grandparent gives a crappy present. You tell the truth, and get in trouble for it. That time a lie was actually required. Most confusing
------
You’re scaring the hoes. I’m forming emotionally intimate relationships with the hoes. We are not the same
------
The elites don’t want you to know this, but you can talk about your true feelings with the bros too
------
I don't think I've ever fallen in love at first sight, but sometimes I see a face and instantly know that I could never love them
------
Well I can't see how this innovative COVID testing glory hole could possibly become its own porn genre.
------
Engineers don't owe you engines
------
I can accept "they" as a singular pronoun, but only if it is accompanied by the singular verb. For example: they is on their fifth white claw.
------
Bluechecks posting their wordle scores are the worst. Hey look everyone, I did pretty well at a total midwit game!
------
Biggest cultural different in tech cos right now is cameras on or cameras off meetings. I'm definitely a camera off guy. I have work to do this isn't Shahs of Sunset

Do you need your morning coffee or do you need to stop staying up until 2:30 doing a wiki deep dive on Stalin's career as a bank robber?
------
Spoiler alert: although the myth was widely promulgated, there's no evidence that Stalin actually robbed a bank or train
------
Lead emoji designer: No, that looks too much like an actual eggplant. We're designing the standin for the human male member here, make it more plump, juicy, and inviting!
------
You will never have all of your needs fulfilled by one person. If that's what you think a "soul mate" is, it is not going to happen. And that's completely ok
------
It's actually pretty touching when you know that large parts of you don't make sense to them, and they clearly care dearly anyhow. It's ok, she doesn't make sense to me either
------
When it comes to the parts she doesn't get, I find friends who share those interests. But do make sure your needs are met one way or another
------
A recession is a psychological phenomenon as much as it is an economic one. It usually doesn't end until the misery it caused has matched the exuberance of the previous upward trend. That's when people feel it's over
------
Granted, there are many real world factors at play in the economy today that have nothing to do with psychology: the droughts, disease. But the choice of when to start expanding again is still highly influenced by feelings
------
Whenever some dickhead blathering on about his home theater setup uses the words "more immersive" I immediately knee him in the balls
------
You know what's immersive? Not watching Fast and Furious movies is the cornerstone of my personal philosophy. It's not about having 9 speakers
------
Yeah if you want something done, ask a busy person. If it’s not really a priority, ask a guy who woke up at one and immediately turned on a playstation
------
Women, do you love She Hulk? Do you just love it? It's FOR YOU. If you don't love it then I don't even know what the point was
------
I watched it next to a woman, and she was on her phone the whole time. She couldn't pay attention for more than a minute at a time. Selling the OC captivates her.
------
What if Charles offers to be king of America too? Like just be king of all of it again? Kinda fun, right? He promises not to be all shitty about it like our last one
------
Real question is, who will be named King's Hand? This could be where bojo makes his move!
------
Corona fever dreams, night three. There is a war inside of me. No quarter is asked and none is given. Either this virus will consume me entire, or I will destroy it for good, for all mankind
------
King Charles like I finally won this game of thrones! 75 years of intricate plotting and scheming paid off!
------
Well I think corona finally got me. Fever 100. I’ll be fine. You are all awesome. 
*starts hallucinating, punches vanity mirror, the doors music plays*

I mean if I’m going to suffer obv I will milk for a few likes
------
You don’t have to eat food you don’t want to eat, ever. If someone insists they are the rude ones. Literally putting something inside of your body or not is a deeply personal choice.
------
Yeah, other people will get their feelings hurt by this. They’ll survive. Do it a few times and they will simply accept it.

I can’t even express how much better I felt in general when I instituted this policy.

If unruly AI was the only possible threat we faced, we might consider not moving forward with it, but we need superhuman machine learning to get us out of all the other jams we’re in, so we have to just floor it and hope it only eats some of us

I feel so bad for the grads who put in the hard work to get a masters in art and land a six figure job at one of the big art firms, only to have expectations crushed by dall-e

Need new bailout, Biden. Social contract has been violated

As children, adults tell us not to lie, and then we see them lie constantly. It took me a lot longer than most to understand what they really meant: only lie when you can get away with it. Lie well or don’t lie at all
------
A grandparent gives a crappy present. You tell the truth, and get in trouble for it. That time a lie was actually required. Most confusing
------
You’re scaring the hoes. I’m forming emotionally intimate relationships with the hoes. We are not the same
------
The elites don’t want you to know this, but you can talk about your true feelings with the bros too
------
I don't think I've ever fallen in love at first sight, but sometimes I see a face and instantly know that I could never love them
------
Well I can't see how this innovative COVID testing glory hole could possibly become its own porn genre.
------
Engineers don't owe you engines
------
I can accept "they" as a singular pronoun, but only if it is accompanied by the singular verb. For example: they is on their fifth white claw.
------
Bluechecks posting their wordle scores are the worst. Hey look everyone, I did pretty well at a total midwit game!
------
Biggest cultural different in tech cos right now is cameras on or cameras off meetings. I'm definitely a camera off guy. I have work to do this isn't Shahs of Sunset

Do you need your morning coffee or do you need to stop staying up until 2:30 doing a wiki deep dive on Stalin's career as a bank robber?
------
Spoiler alert: although the myth was widely promulgated, there's no evidence that Stalin actually robbed a bank or train
------
Lead emoji designer: No, that looks too much like an actual eggplant. We're designing the standin for the human male member here, make it more plump, juicy, and inviting!
------
You will never have all of your needs fulfilled by one person. If that's what you think a "soul mate" is, it is not going to happen. And that's completely ok
------
It's actually pretty touching when you know that large parts of you don't make sense to them, and they clearly care dearly anyhow. It's ok, she doesn't make sense to me either
------
When it comes to the parts she doesn't get, I find friends who share those interests. But do make sure your needs are met one way or another
------
A recession is a psychological phenomenon as much as it is an economic one. It usually doesn't end until the misery it caused has matched the exuberance of the previous upward trend. That's when people feel it's over
------
Granted, there are many real world factors at play in the economy today that have nothing to do with psychology: the droughts, disease. But the choice of when to start expanding again is still highly influenced by feelings
------
Whenever some dickhead blathering on about his home theater setup uses the words "more immersive" I immediately knee him in the balls
------
You know what's immersive? Not watching Fast and Furious movies is the cornerstone of my personal philosophy. It's not about having 9 speakers
------
Yeah if you want something done, ask a busy person. If it’s not really a priority, ask a guy who woke up at one and immediately turned on a playstation
------
Women, do you love She Hulk? Do you just love it? It's FOR YOU. If you don't love it then I don't even know what the point was
------
I watched it next to a woman, and she was on her phone the whole time. She couldn't pay attention for more than a minute at a time. Selling the OC captivates her.
------
What if Charles offers to be king of America too? Like just be king of all of it again? Kinda fun, right? He promises not to be all shitty about it like our last one
------
Real question is, who will be named King's Hand? This could be where bojo makes his move!
------
Corona fever dreams, night three. There is a war inside of me. No quarter is asked and none is given. Either this virus will consume me entire, or I will destroy it for good, for all mankind
------
King Charles like I finally won this game of thrones! 75 years of intricate plotting and scheming paid off!
------
Well I think corona finally got me. Fever 100. I’ll be fine. You are all awesome. 
*starts hallucinating, punches vanity mirror, the doors music plays*

I mean if I’m going to suffer obv I will milk for a few likes
------
You don’t have to eat food you don’t want to eat, ever. If someone insists they are the rude ones. Literally putting something inside of your body or not is a deeply personal choice.
------
Yeah, other people will get their feelings hurt by this. They’ll survive. Do it a few times and they will simply accept it.

I can’t even express how much better I felt in general when I instituted this policy.

If unruly AI was the only possible threat we faced, we might consider not moving forward with it, but we need superhuman machine learning to get us out of all the other jams we’re in, so we have to just floor it and hope it only eats some of us

I feel so bad for the grads who put in the hard work to get a masters in art and land a six figure job at one of the big art firms, only to have expectations crushed by dall-e

Need new bailout, Biden. Social contract has been violated

As children, adults tell us not to lie, and then we see them lie constantly. It took me a lot longer than most to understand what they really meant: only lie when you can get away with it. Lie well or don’t lie at all
------
A grandparent gives a crappy present. You tell the truth, and get in trouble for it. That time a lie was actually required. Most confusing
------
You’re scaring the hoes. I’m forming emotionally intimate relationships with the hoes. We are not the same
------
The elites don’t want you to know this, but you can talk about your true feelings with the bros too
------
I don't think I've ever fallen in love at first sight, but sometimes I see a face and instantly know that I could never love them
------
Well I can't see how this innovative COVID testing glory hole could possibly become its own porn genre.
------
Engineers don't owe you engines
------
I can accept "they" as a singular pronoun, but only if it is accompanied by the singular verb. For example: they is on their fifth white claw.
------
Bluechecks posting their wordle scores are the worst. Hey look everyone, I did pretty well at a total midwit game!
------
Biggest cultural different in tech cos right now is cameras on or cameras off meetings. I'm definitely a camera off guy. I have work to do this isn't Shahs of Sunset

Do you need your morning coffee or do you need to stop staying up until 2:30 doing a wiki deep dive on Stalin's career as a bank robber?
------
Spoiler alert: although the myth was widely promulgated, there's no evidence that Stalin actually robbed a bank or train
------
Lead emoji designer: No, that looks too much like an actual eggplant. We're designing the standin for the human male member here, make it more plump, juicy, and inviting!
------
You will never have all of your needs fulfilled by one person. If that's what you think a "soul mate" is, it is not going to happen. And that's completely ok
------
It's actually pretty touching when you know that large parts of you don't make sense to them, and they clearly care dearly anyhow. It's ok, she doesn't make sense to me either
------
When it comes to the parts she doesn't get, I find friends who share those interests. But do make sure your needs are met one way or another
------
A recession is a psychological phenomenon as much as it is an economic one. It usually doesn't end until the misery it caused has matched the exuberance of the previous upward trend. That's when people feel it's over
------
Granted, there are many real world factors at play in the economy today that have nothing to do with psychology: the droughts, disease. But the choice of when to start expanding again is still highly influenced by feelings
------
Whenever some dickhead blathering on about his home theater setup uses the words "more immersive" I immediately knee him in the balls
------
You know what's immersive? Not watching Fast and Furious movies is the cornerstone of my personal philosophy. It's not about having 9 speakers
------
Yeah if you want something done, ask a busy person. If it’s not really a priority, ask a guy who woke up at one and immediately turned on a playstation
------
Women, do you love She Hulk? Do you just love it? It's FOR YOU. If you don't love it then I don't even know what the point was
------
I watched it next to a woman, and she was on her phone the whole time. She couldn't pay attention for more than a minute at a time. Selling the OC captivates her.
------
What if Charles offers to be king of America too? Like just be king of all of it again? Kinda fun, right? He promises not to be all shitty about it like our last one
------
Real question is, who will be named King's Hand? This could be where bojo makes his move!
------
Corona fever dreams, night three. There is a war inside of me. No quarter is asked and none is given. Either this virus will consume me entire, or I will destroy it for good, for all mankind
------
King Charles like I finally won this game of thrones! 75 years of intricate plotting and scheming paid off!
------
Well I think corona finally got me. Fever 100. I’ll be fine. You are all awesome. 
*starts hallucinating, punches vanity mirror, the doors music plays*

I mean if I’m going to suffer obv I will milk for a few likes
------
You don’t have to eat food you don’t want to eat, ever. If someone insists they are the rude ones. Literally putting something inside of your body or not is a deeply personal choice.
------
Yeah, other people will get their feelings hurt by this. They’ll survive. Do it a few times and they will simply accept it.

I can’t even express how much better I felt in general when I instituted this policy.

If unruly AI was the only possible threat we faced, we might consider not moving forward with it, but we need superhuman machine learning to get us out of all the other jams we’re in, so we have to just floor it and hope it only eats some of us

I feel so bad for the grads who put in the hard work to get a masters in art and land a six figure job at one of the big art firms, only to have expectations crushed by dall-e

Need new bailout, Biden. Social contract has been violated

As children, adults tell us not to lie, and then we see them lie constantly. It took me a lot longer than most to understand what they really meant: only lie when you can get away with it. Lie well or don’t lie at all
------
A grandparent gives a crappy present. You tell the truth, and get in trouble for it. That time a lie was actually required. Most confusing
------
You’re scaring the hoes. I’m forming emotionally intimate relationships with the hoes. We are not the same
------
The elites don’t want you to know this, but you can talk about your true feelings with the bros too
------
I don't think I've ever fallen in love at first sight, but sometimes I see a face and instantly know that I could never love them
------
Well I can't see how this innovative COVID testing glory hole could possibly become its own porn genre.
------
Engineers don't owe you engines
------
I can accept "they" as a singular pronoun, but only if it is accompanied by the singular verb. For example: they is on their fifth white claw.
------
Bluechecks posting their wordle scores are the worst. Hey look everyone, I did pretty well at a total midwit game!
------
Biggest cultural different in tech cos right now is cameras on or cameras off meetings. I'm definitely a camera off guy. I have work to do this isn't Shahs of Sunset

Do you need your morning coffee or do you need to stop staying up until 2:30 doing a wiki deep dive on Stalin's career as a bank robber?
------
Spoiler alert: although the myth was widely promulgated, there's no evidence that Stalin actually robbed a bank or train
------
Lead emoji designer: No, that looks too much like an actual eggplant. We're designing the standin for the human male member here, make it more plump, juicy, and inviting!
------
You will never have all of your needs fulfilled by one person. If that's what you think a "soul mate" is, it is not going to happen. And that's completely ok
------
It's actually pretty touching when you know that large parts of you don't make sense to them, and they clearly care dearly anyhow. It's ok, she doesn't make sense to me either
------
When it comes to the parts she doesn't get, I find friends who share those interests. But do make sure your needs are met one way or another
------
A recession is a psychological phenomenon as much as it is an economic one. It usually doesn't end until the misery it caused has matched the exuberance of the previous upward trend. That's when people feel it's over
------
Granted, there are many real world factors at play in the economy today that have nothing to do with psychology: the droughts, disease. But the choice of when to start expanding again is still highly influenced by feelings
------
Whenever some dickhead blathering on about his home theater setup uses the words "more immersive" I immediately knee him in the balls
------
You know what's immersive? Not watching Fast and Furious movies is the cornerstone of my personal philosophy. It's not about having 9 speakers
------
Yeah if you want something done, ask a busy person. If it’s not really a priority, ask a guy who woke up at one and immediately turned on a playstation
------
Women, do you love She Hulk? Do you just love it? It's FOR YOU. If you don't love it then I don't even know what the point was
------
I watched it next to a woman, and she was on her phone the whole time. She couldn't pay attention for more than a minute at a time. Selling the OC captivates her.
------
What if Charles offers to be king of America too? Like just be king of all of it again? Kinda fun, right? He promises not to be all shitty about it like our last one
------
Real question is, who will be named King's Hand? This could be where bojo makes his move!
------
Corona fever dreams, night three. There is a war inside of me. No quarter is asked and none is given. Either this virus will consume me entire, or I will destroy it for good, for all mankind
------
King Charles like I finally won this game of thrones! 75 years of intricate plotting and scheming paid off!
------
Well I think corona finally got me. Fever 100. I’ll be fine. You are all awesome. 
*starts hallucinating, punches vanity mirror, the doors music plays*

I mean if I’m going to suffer obv I will milk for a few likes
------
You don’t have to eat food you don’t want to eat, ever. If someone insists they are the rude ones. Literally putting something inside of your body or not is a deeply personal choice.
------
Yeah, other people will get their feelings hurt by this. They’ll survive. Do it a few times and they will simply accept it.

I can’t even express how much better I felt in general when I instituted this policy.

If unruly AI was the only possible threat we faced, we might consider not moving forward with it, but we need superhuman machine learning to get us out of all the other jams we’re in, so we have to just floor it and hope it only eats some of us

I feel so bad for the grads who put in the hard work to get a masters in art and land a six figure job at one of the big art firms, only to have expectations crushed by dall-e

Need new bailout, Biden. Social contract has been violated

As children, adults tell us not to lie, and then we see them lie constantly. It took me a lot longer than most to understand what they really meant: only lie when you can get away with it. Lie well or don’t lie at all
------
A grandparent gives a crappy present. You tell the truth, and get in trouble for it. That time a lie was actually required. Most confusing
------
You’re scaring the hoes. I’m forming emotionally intimate relationships with the hoes. We are not the same
------
The elites don’t want you to know this, but you can talk about your true feelings with the bros too
------
I don't think I've ever fallen in love at first sight, but sometimes I see a face and instantly know that I could never love them
------
Well I can't see how this innovative COVID testing glory hole could possibly become its own porn genre.
------
Engineers don't owe you engines
------
I can accept "they" as a singular pronoun, but only if it is accompanied by the singular verb. For example: they is on their fifth white claw.
------
Bluechecks posting their wordle scores are the worst. Hey look everyone, I did pretty well at a total midwit game!
------
Biggest cultural different in tech cos right now is cameras on or cameras off meetings. I'm definitely a camera off guy. I have work to do this isn't Shahs of Sunset

Do you need your morning coffee or do you need to stop staying up until 2:30 doing a wiki deep dive on Stalin's career as a bank robber?
------
Spoiler alert: although the myth was widely promulgated, there's no evidence that Stalin actually robbed a bank or train
------
Lead emoji designer: No, that looks too much like an actual eggplant. We're designing the standin for the human male member here, make it more plump, juicy, and inviting!
------
You will never have all of your needs fulfilled by one person. If that's what you think a "soul mate" is, it is not going to happen. And that's completely ok
------
It's actually pretty touching when you know that large parts of you don't make sense to them, and they clearly care dearly anyhow. It's ok, she doesn't make sense to me either
------
When it comes to the parts she doesn't get, I find friends who share those interests. But do make sure your needs are met one way or another
------
A recession is a psychological phenomenon as much as it is an economic one. It usually doesn't end until the misery it caused has matched the exuberance of the previous upward trend. That's when people feel it's over
------
Granted, there are many real world factors at play in the economy today that have nothing to do with psychology: the droughts, disease. But the choice of when to start expanding again is still highly influenced by feelings
------
Whenever some dickhead blathering on about his home theater setup uses the words "more immersive" I immediately knee him in the balls
------
You know what's immersive? Not watching Fast and Furious movies is the cornerstone of my personal philosophy. It's not about having 9 speakers
------
Yeah if you want something done, ask a busy person. If it’s not really a priority, ask a guy who woke up at one and immediately turned on a playstation
------
Women, do you love She Hulk? Do you just love it? It's FOR YOU. If you don't love it then I don't even know what the point was
------
I watched it next to a woman, and she was on her phone the whole time. She couldn't pay attention for more than a minute at a time. Selling the OC captivates her.
------
What if Charles offers to be king of America too? Like just be king of all of it again? Kinda fun, right? He promises not to be all shitty about it like our last one
------
Real question is, who will be named King's Hand? This could be where bojo makes his move!
------
Corona fever dreams, night three. There is a war inside of me. No quarter is asked and none is given. Either this virus will consume me entire, or I will destroy it for good, for all mankind
------
King Charles like I finally won this game of thrones! 75 years of intricate plotting and scheming paid off!
------
Well I think corona finally got me. Fever 100. I’ll be fine. You are all awesome. 
*starts hallucinating, punches vanity mirror, the doors music plays*

I mean if I’m going to suffer obv I will milk for a few likes
------
You don’t have to eat food you don’t want to eat, ever. If someone insists they are the rude ones. Literally putting something inside of your body or not is a deeply personal choice.
------
Yeah, other people will get their feelings hurt by this. They’ll survive. Do it a few times and they will simply accept it.

I can’t even express how much better I felt in general when I instituted this policy.

If unruly AI was the only possible threat we faced, we might consider not moving forward with it, but we need superhuman machine learning to get us out of all the other jams we’re in, so we have to just floor it and hope it only eats some of us

I feel so bad for the grads who put in the hard work to get a masters in art and land a six figure job at one of the big art firms, only to have expectations crushed by dall-e

Need new bailout, Biden. Social contract has been violated

As children, adults tell us not to lie, and then we see them lie constantly. It took me a lot longer than most to understand what they really meant: only lie when you can get away with it. Lie well or don’t lie at all
------
A grandparent gives a crappy present. You tell the truth, and get in trouble for it. That time a lie was actually required. Most confusing
------
You’re scaring the hoes. I’m forming emotionally intimate relationships with the hoes. We are not the same
------
The elites don’t want you to know this, but you can talk about your true feelings with the bros too
------
I don't think I've ever fallen in love at first sight, but sometimes I see a face and instantly know that I could never love them
------
Well I can't see how this innovative COVID testing glory hole could possibly become its own porn genre.
------
Engineers don't owe you engines
------
I can accept "they" as a singular pronoun, but only if it is accompanied by the singular verb. For example: they is on their fifth white claw.
------
Bluechecks posting their wordle scores are the worst. Hey look everyone, I did pretty well at a total midwit game!
------
Biggest cultural different in tech cos right now is cameras on or cameras off meetings. I'm definitely a camera off guy. I have work to do this isn't Shahs of Sunset

Do you need your morning coffee or do you need to stop staying up until 2:30 doing a wiki deep dive on Stalin's career as a bank robber?
------
Spoiler alert: although the myth was widely promulgated, there's no evidence that Stalin actually robbed a bank or train
------
Lead emoji designer: No, that looks too much like an actual eggplant. We're designing the standin for the human male member here, make it more plump, juicy, and inviting!
------
You will never have all of your needs fulfilled by one person. If that's what you think a "soul mate" is, it is not going to happen. And that's completely ok
------
It's actually pretty touching when you know that large parts of you don't make sense to them, and they clearly care dearly anyhow. It's ok, she doesn't make sense to me either
------
When it comes to the parts she doesn't get, I find friends who share those interests. But do make sure your needs are met one way or another
------
A recession is a psychological phenomenon as much as it is an economic one. It usually doesn't end until the misery it caused has matched the exuberance of the previous upward trend. That's when people feel it's over
------
Granted, there are many real world factors at play in the economy today that have nothing to do with psychology: the droughts, disease. But the choice of when to start expanding again is still highly influenced by feelings
------
Whenever some dickhead blathering on about his home theater setup uses the words "more immersive" I immediately knee him in the balls
------
You know what's immersive? Not watching Fast and Furious movies is the cornerstone of my personal philosophy. It's not about having 9 speakers
------
Yeah if you want something done, ask a busy person. If it’s not really a priority, ask a guy who woke up at one and immediately turned on a playstation
------
Women, do you love She Hulk? Do you just love it? It's FOR YOU. If you don't love it then I don't even know what the point was
------
I watched it next to a woman, and she was on her phone the whole time. She couldn't pay attention for more than a minute at a time. Selling the OC captivates her.
------
What if Charles offers to be king of America too? Like just be king of all of it again? Kinda fun, right? He promises not to be all shitty about it like our last one
------
Real question is, who will be named King's Hand? This could be where bojo makes his move!
------
Corona fever dreams, night three. There is a war inside of me. No quarter is asked and none is given. Either this virus will consume me entire, or I will destroy it for good, for all mankind
------
King Charles like I finally won this game of thrones! 75 years of intricate plotting and scheming paid off!
------
Well I think corona finally got me. Fever 100. I’ll be fine. You are all awesome. 
*starts hallucinating, punches vanity mirror, the doors music plays*

I mean if I’m going to suffer obv I will milk for a few likes
------
You don’t have to eat food you don’t want to eat, ever. If someone insists they are the rude ones. Literally putting something inside of your body or not is a deeply personal choice.
------
Yeah, other people will get their feelings hurt by this. They’ll survive. Do it a few times and they will simply accept it.

I can’t even express how much better I felt in general when I instituted this policy.

If unruly AI was the only possible threat we faced, we might consider not moving forward with it, but we need superhuman machine learning to get us out of all the other jams we’re in, so we have to just floor it and hope it only eats some of us

I feel so bad for the grads who put in the hard work to get a masters in art and land a six figure job at one of the big art firms, only to have expectations crushed by dall-e

Need new bailout, Biden. Social contract has been violated

As children, adults tell us not to lie, and then we see them lie constantly. It took me a lot longer than most to understand what they really meant: only lie when you can get away with it. Lie well or don’t lie at all
------
A grandparent gives a crappy present. You tell the truth, and get in trouble for it. That time a lie was actually required. Most confusing
------
You’re scaring the hoes. I’m forming emotionally intimate relationships with the hoes. We are not the same
------
The elites don’t want you to know this, but you can talk about your true feelings with the bros too
------
I don't think I've ever fallen in love at first sight, but sometimes I see a face and instantly know that I could never love them
------
Well I can't see how this innovative COVID testing glory hole could possibly become its own porn genre.
------
Engineers don't owe you engines
------
I can accept "they" as a singular pronoun, but only if it is accompanied by the singular verb. For example: they is on their fifth white claw.
------
Bluechecks posting their wordle scores are the worst. Hey look everyone, I did pretty well at a total midwit game!
------
Biggest cultural different in tech cos right now is cameras on or cameras off meetings. I'm definitely a camera off guy. I have work to do this isn't Shahs of Sunset

Do you need your morning coffee or do you need to stop staying up until 2:30 doing a wiki deep dive on Stalin's career as a bank robber?
------
Spoiler alert: although the myth was widely promulgated, there's no evidence that Stalin actually robbed a bank or train
------
Lead emoji designer: No, that looks too much like an actual eggplant. We're designing the standin for the human male member here, make it more plump, juicy, and inviting!
------
You will never have all of your needs fulfilled by one person. If that's what you think a "soul mate" is, it is not going to happen. And that's completely ok
------
It's actually pretty touching when you know that large parts of you don't make sense to them, and they clearly care dearly anyhow. It's ok, she doesn't make sense to me either
------
When it comes to the parts she doesn't get, I find friends who share those interests. But do make sure your needs are met one way or another
------
A recession is a psychological phenomenon as much as it is an economic one. It usually doesn't end until the misery it caused has matched the exuberance of the previous upward trend. That's when people feel it's over
------
Granted, there are many real world factors at play in the economy today that have nothing to do with psychology: the droughts, disease. But the choice of when to start expanding again is still highly influenced by feelings
------
Whenever some dickhead blathering on about his home theater setup uses the words "more immersive" I immediately knee him in the balls
------
You know what's immersive? Not watching Fast and Furious movies is the cornerstone of my personal philosophy. It's not about having 9 speakers
------
Yeah if you want something done, ask a busy person. If it’s not really a priority, ask a guy who woke up at one and immediately turned on a playstation
------
Women, do you love She Hulk? Do you just love it? It's FOR YOU. If you don't love it then I don't even know what the point was
------
I watched it next to a woman, and she was on her phone the whole time. She couldn't pay attention for more than a minute at a time. Selling the OC captivates her.
------
What if Charles offers to be king of America too? Like just be king of all of it again? Kinda fun, right? He promises not to be all shitty about it like our last one
------
Real question is, who will be named King's Hand? This could be where bojo makes his move!
------
Corona fever dreams, night three. There is a war inside of me. No quarter is asked and none is given. Either this virus will consume me entire, or I will destroy it for good, for all mankind
------
King Charles like I finally won this game of thrones! 75 years of intricate plotting and scheming paid off!
------
Well I think corona finally got me. Fever 100. I’ll be fine. You are all awesome. 
*starts hallucinating, punches vanity mirror, the doors music plays*

I mean if I’m going to suffer obv I will milk for a few likes
------
You don’t have to eat food you don’t want to eat, ever. If someone insists they are the rude ones. Literally putting something inside of your body or not is a deeply personal choice.
------
Yeah, other people will get their feelings hurt by this. They’ll survive. Do it a few times and they will simply accept it.

I can’t even express how much better I felt in general when I instituted this policy.

If unruly AI was the only possible threat we faced, we might consider not moving forward with it, but we need superhuman machine learning to get us out of all the other jams we’re in, so we have to just floor it and hope it only eats some of us

I feel so bad for the grads who put in the hard work to get a masters in art and land a six figure job at one of the big art firms, only to have expectations crushed by dall-e

Need new bailout, Biden. Social contract has been violated

As children, adults tell us not to lie, and then we see them lie constantly. It took me a lot longer than most to understand what they really meant: only lie when you can get away with it. Lie well or don’t lie at all
------
A grandparent gives a crappy present. You tell the truth, and get in trouble for it. That time a lie was actually required. Most confusing
------
You’re scaring the hoes. I’m forming emotionally intimate relationships with the hoes. We are not the same
------
The elites don’t want you to know this, but you can talk about your true feelings with the bros too
------
I don't think I've ever fallen in love at first sight, but sometimes I see a face and instantly know that I could never love them
------
Well I can't see how this innovative COVID testing glory hole could possibly become its own porn genre.
------
Engineers don't owe you engines
------
I can accept "they" as a singular pronoun, but only if it is accompanied by the singular verb. For example: they is on their fifth white claw.
------
Bluechecks posting their wordle scores are the worst. Hey look everyone, I did pretty well at a total midwit game!
------
Biggest cultural different in tech cos right now is cameras on or cameras off meetings. I'm definitely a camera off guy. I have work to do this isn't Shahs of Sunset

Do you need your morning coffee or do you need to stop staying up until 2:30 doing a wiki deep dive on Stalin's career as a bank robber?
------
Spoiler alert: although the myth was widely promulgated, there's no evidence that Stalin actually robbed a bank or train
------
Lead emoji designer: No, that looks too much like an actual eggplant. We're designing the standin for the human male member here, make it more plump, juicy, and inviting!
------
You will never have all of your needs fulfilled by one person. If that's what you think a "soul mate" is, it is not going to happen. And that's completely ok
------
It's actually pretty touching when you know that large parts of you don't make sense to them, and they clearly care dearly anyhow. It's ok, she doesn't make sense to me either
------
When it comes to the parts she doesn't get, I find friends who share those interests. But do make sure your needs are met one way or another
------
A recession is a psychological phenomenon as much as it is an economic one. It usually doesn't end until the misery it caused has matched the exuberance of the previous upward trend. That's when people feel it's over
------
Granted, there are many real world factors at play in the economy today that have nothing to do with psychology: the droughts, disease. But the choice of when to start expanding again is still highly influenced by feelings
------
Whenever some dickhead blathering on about his home theater setup uses the words "more immersive" I immediately knee him in the balls
------
You know what's immersive? Not watching Fast and Furious movies is the cornerstone of my personal philosophy. It's not about having 9 speakers
------
Yeah if you want something done, ask a busy person. If it’s not really a priority, ask a guy who woke up at one and immediately turned on a playstation
------
Women, do you love She Hulk? Do you just love it? It's FOR YOU. If you don't love it then I don't even know what the point was
------
I watched it next to a woman, and she was on her phone the whole time. She couldn't pay attention for more than a minute at a time. Selling the OC captivates her.
------
What if Charles offers to be king of America too? Like just be king of all of it again? Kinda fun, right? He promises not to be all shitty about it like our last one
------
Real question is, who will be named King's Hand? This could be where bojo makes his move!
------
Corona fever dreams, night three. There is a war inside of me. No quarter is asked and none is given. Either this virus will consume me entire, or I will destroy it for good, for all mankind
------
King Charles like I finally won this game of thrones! 75 years of intricate plotting and scheming paid off!
------
Well I think corona finally got me. Fever 100. I’ll be fine. You are all awesome. 
*starts hallucinating, punches vanity mirror, the doors music plays*

I mean if I’m going to suffer obv I will milk for a few likes
------
You don’t have to eat food you don’t want to eat, ever. If someone insists they are the rude ones. Literally putting something inside of your body or not is a deeply personal choice.
------
Yeah, other people will get their feelings hurt by this. They’ll survive. Do it a few times and they will simply accept it.

I can’t even express how much better I felt in general when I instituted this policy.

If unruly AI was the only possible threat we faced, we might consider not moving forward with it, but we need superhuman machine learning to get us out of all the other jams we’re in, so we have to just floor it and hope it only eats some of us

I feel so bad for the grads who put in the hard work to get a masters in art and land a six figure job at one of the big art firms, only to have expectations crushed by dall-e

Need new bailout, Biden. Social contract has been violated

As children, adults tell us not to lie, and then we see them lie constantly. It took me a lot longer than most to understand what they really meant: only lie when you can get away with it. Lie well or don’t lie at all
------
A grandparent gives a crappy present. You tell the truth, and get in trouble for it. That time a lie was actually required. Most confusing
------
You’re scaring the hoes. I’m forming emotionally intimate relationships with the hoes. We are not the same
------
The elites don’t want you to know this, but you can talk about your true feelings with the bros too
------
I don't think I've ever fallen in love at first sight, but sometimes I see a face and instantly know that I could never love them
------
Well I can't see how this innovative COVID testing glory hole could possibly become its own porn genre.
------
Engineers don't owe you engines
------
I can accept "they" as a singular pronoun, but only if it is accompanied by the singular verb. For example: they is on their fifth white claw.
------
Bluechecks posting their wordle scores are the worst. Hey look everyone, I did pretty well at a total midwit game!
------
Biggest cultural different in tech cos right now is cameras on or cameras off meetings. I'm definitely a camera off guy. I have work to do this isn't Shahs of Sunset

Do you need your morning coffee or do you need to stop staying up until 2:30 doing a wiki deep dive on Stalin's career as a bank robber?
------
Spoiler alert: although the myth was widely promulgated, there's no evidence that Stalin actually robbed a bank or train
------
Lead emoji designer: No, that looks too much like an actual eggplant. We're designing the standin for the human male member here, make it more plump, juicy, and inviting!
------
You will never have all of your needs fulfilled by one person. If that's what you think a "soul mate" is, it is not going to happen. And that's completely ok
------
It's actually pretty touching when you know that large parts of you don't make sense to them, and they clearly care dearly anyhow. It's ok, she doesn't make sense to me either
------
When it comes to the parts she doesn't get, I find friends who share those interests. But do make sure your needs are met one way or another
------
A recession is a psychological phenomenon as much as it is an economic one. It usually doesn't end until the misery it caused has matched the exuberance of the previous upward trend. That's when people feel it's over
------
Granted, there are many real world factors at play in the economy today that have nothing to do with psychology: the droughts, disease. But the choice of when to start expanding again is still highly influenced by feelings
------
Whenever some dickhead blathering on about his home theater setup uses the words "more immersive" I immediately knee him in the balls
------
You know what's immersive? Not watching Fast and Furious movies is the cornerstone of my personal philosophy. It's not about having 9 speakers
------
Yeah if you want something done, ask a busy person. If it’s not really a priority, ask a guy who woke up at one and immediately turned on a playstation
------
Women, do you love She Hulk? Do you just love it? It's FOR YOU. If you don't love it then I don't even know what the point was
------
I watched it next to a woman, and she was on her phone the whole time. She couldn't pay attention for more than a minute at a time. Selling the OC captivates her.
------
What if Charles offers to be king of America too? Like just be king of all of it again? Kinda fun, right? He promises not to be all shitty about it like our last one
------
Real question is, who will be named King's Hand? This could be where bojo makes his move!
------
Corona fever dreams, night three. There is a war inside of me. No quarter is asked and none is given. Either this virus will consume me entire, or I will destroy it for good, for all mankind
------
King Charles like I finally won this game of thrones! 75 years of intricate plotting and scheming paid off!
------
Well I think corona finally got me. Fever 100. I’ll be fine. You are all awesome. 
*starts hallucinating, punches vanity mirror, the doors music plays*

I mean if I’m going to suffer obv I will milk for a few likes
------
You don’t have to eat food you don’t want to eat, ever. If someone insists they are the rude ones. Literally putting something inside of your body or not is a deeply personal choice.
------
Yeah, other people will get their feelings hurt by this. They’ll survive. Do it a few times and they will simply accept it.

I can’t even express how much better I felt in general when I instituted this policy.

If unruly AI was the only possible threat we faced, we might consider not moving forward with it, but we need superhuman machine learning to get us out of all the other jams we’re in, so we have to just floor it and hope it only eats some of us

I feel so bad for the grads who put in the hard work to get a masters in art and land a six figure job at one of the big art firms, only to have expectations crushed by dall-e

Need new bailout, Biden. Social contract has been violated

As children, adults tell us not to lie, and then we see them lie constantly. It took me a lot longer than most to understand what they really meant: only lie when you can get away with it. Lie well or don’t lie at all
------
A grandparent gives a crappy present. You tell the truth, and get in trouble for it. That time a lie was actually required. Most confusing
------
You’re scaring the hoes. I’m forming emotionally intimate relationships with the hoes. We are not the same
------
The elites don’t want you to know this, but you can talk about your true feelings with the bros too
------
I don't think I've ever fallen in love at first sight, but sometimes I see a face and instantly know that I could never love them
------
Well I can't see how this innovative COVID testing glory hole could possibly become its own porn genre.
------
Engineers don't owe you engines
------
I can accept "they" as a singular pronoun, but only if it is accompanied by the singular verb. For example: they is on their fifth white claw.
------
Bluechecks posting their wordle scores are the worst. Hey look everyone, I did pretty well at a total midwit game!
------
Biggest cultural different in tech cos right now is cameras on or cameras off meetings. I'm definitely a camera off guy. I have work to do this isn't Shahs of Sunset

Do you need your morning coffee or do you need to stop staying up until 2:30 doing a wiki deep dive on Stalin's career as a bank robber?
------
Spoiler alert: although the myth was widely promulgated, there's no evidence that Stalin actually robbed a bank or train
------
Lead emoji designer: No, that looks too much like an actual eggplant. We're designing the standin for the human male member here, make it more plump, juicy, and inviting!
------
You will never have all of your needs fulfilled by one person. If that's what you think a "soul mate" is, it is not going to happen. And that's completely ok
------
It's actually pretty touching when you know that large parts of you don't make sense to them, and they clearly care dearly anyhow. It's ok, she doesn't make sense to me either
------
When it comes to the parts she doesn't get, I find friends who share those interests. But do make sure your needs are met one way or another
------
A recession is a psychological phenomenon as much as it is an economic one. It usually doesn't end until the misery it caused has matched the exuberance of the previous upward trend. That's when people feel it's over
------
Granted, there are many real world factors at play in the economy today that have nothing to do with psychology: the droughts, disease. But the choice of when to start expanding again is still highly influenced by feelings
------
Whenever some dickhead blathering on about his home theater setup uses the words "more immersive" I immediately knee him in the balls
------
You know what's immersive? Not watching Fast and Furious movies is the cornerstone of my personal philosophy. It's not about having 9 speakers
------
Yeah if you want something done, ask a busy person. If it’s not really a priority, ask a guy who woke up at one and immediately turned on a playstation
------
Women, do you love She Hulk? Do you just love it? It's FOR YOU. If you don't love it then I don't even know what the point was
------
I watched it next to a woman, and she was on her phone the whole time. She couldn't pay attention for more than a minute at a time. Selling the OC captivates her.
------
What if Charles offers to be king of America too? Like just be king of all of it again? Kinda fun, right? He promises not to be all shitty about it like our last one
------
Real question is, who will be named King's Hand? This could be where bojo makes his move!
------
Corona fever dreams, night three. There is a war inside of me. No quarter is asked and none is given. Either this virus will consume me entire, or I will destroy it for good, for all mankind
------
King Charles like I finally won this game of thrones! 75 years of intricate plotting and scheming paid off!
------
Well I think corona finally got me. Fever 100. I’ll be fine. You are all awesome. 
*starts hallucinating, punches vanity mirror, the doors music plays*

I mean if I’m going to suffer obv I will milk for a few likes
------
You don’t have to eat food you don’t want to eat, ever. If someone insists they are the rude ones. Literally putting something inside of your body or not is a deeply personal choice.
------
Yeah, other people will get their feelings hurt by this. They’ll survive. Do it a few times and they will simply accept it.

I can’t even express how much better I felt in general when I instituted this policy.

If unruly AI was the only possible threat we faced, we might consider not moving forward with it, but we need superhuman machine learning to get us out of all the other jams we’re in, so we have to just floor it and hope it only eats some of us

I feel so bad for the grads who put in the hard work to get a masters in art and land a six figure job at one of the big art firms, only to have expectations crushed by dall-e

Need new bailout, Biden. Social contract has been violated

As children, adults tell us not to lie, and then we see them lie constantly. It took me a lot longer than most to understand what they really meant: only lie when you can get away with it. Lie well or don’t lie at all
------
A grandparent gives a crappy present. You tell the truth, and get in trouble for it. That time a lie was actually required. Most confusing
------
You’re scaring the hoes. I’m forming emotionally intimate relationships with the hoes. We are not the same
------
The elites don’t want you to know this, but you can talk about your true feelings with the bros too
------
I don't think I've ever fallen in love at first sight, but sometimes I see a face and instantly know that I could never love them
------
Well I can't see how this innovative COVID testing glory hole could possibly become its own porn genre.
------
Engineers don't owe you engines
------
I can accept "they" as a singular pronoun, but only if it is accompanied by the singular verb. For example: they is on their fifth white claw.
------
Bluechecks posting their wordle scores are the worst. Hey look everyone, I did pretty well at a total midwit game!
------
Biggest cultural different in tech cos right now is cameras on or cameras off meetings. I'm definitely a camera off guy. I have work to do this isn't Shahs of Sunset

Do you need your morning coffee or do you need to stop staying up until 2:30 doing a wiki deep dive on Stalin's career as a bank robber?
------
Spoiler alert: although the myth was widely promulgated, there's no evidence that Stalin actually robbed a bank or train
------
Lead emoji designer: No, that looks too much like an actual eggplant. We're designing the standin for the human male member here, make it more plump, juicy, and inviting!
------
You will never have all of your needs fulfilled by one person. If that's what you think a "soul mate" is, it is not going to happen. And that's completely ok
------
It's actually pretty touching when you know that large parts of you don't make sense to them, and they clearly care dearly anyhow. It's ok, she doesn't make sense to me either
------
When it comes to the parts she doesn't get, I find friends who share those interests. But do make sure your needs are met one way or another
------
A recession is a psychological phenomenon as much as it is an economic one. It usually doesn't end until the misery it caused has matched the exuberance of the previous upward trend. That's when people feel it's over
------
Granted, there are many real world factors at play in the economy today that have nothing to do with psychology: the droughts, disease. But the choice of when to start expanding again is still highly influenced by feelings
------
Whenever some dickhead blathering on about his home theater setup uses the words "more immersive" I immediately knee him in the balls
------
You know what's immersive? Not watching Fast and Furious movies is the cornerstone of my personal philosophy. It's not about having 9 speakers
------
Yeah if you want something done, ask a busy person. If it’s not really a priority, ask a guy who woke up at one and immediately turned on a playstation
------
Women, do you love She Hulk? Do you just love it? It's FOR YOU. If you don't love it then I don't even know what the point was
------
I watched it next to a woman, and she was on her phone the whole time. She couldn't pay attention for more than a minute at a time. Selling the OC captivates her.
------
What if Charles offers to be king of America too? Like just be king of all of it again? Kinda fun, right? He promises not to be all shitty about it like our last one
------
Real question is, who will be named King's Hand? This could be where bojo makes his move!
------
Corona fever dreams, night three. There is a war inside of me. No quarter is asked and none is given. Either this virus will consume me entire, or I will destroy it for good, for all mankind
------
King Charles like I finally won this game of thrones! 75 years of intricate plotting and scheming paid off!
------
Well I think corona finally got me. Fever 100. I’ll be fine. You are all awesome. 
*starts hallucinating, punches vanity mirror, the doors music plays*

I mean if I’m going to suffer obv I will milk for a few likes
------
You don’t have to eat food you don’t want to eat, ever. If someone insists they are the rude ones. Literally putting something inside of your body or not is a deeply personal choice.
------
Yeah, other people will get their feelings hurt by this. They’ll survive. Do it a few times and they will simply accept it.

I can’t even express how much better I felt in general when I instituted this policy.

If unruly AI was the only possible threat we faced, we might consider not moving forward with it, but we need superhuman machine learning to get us out of all the other jams we’re in, so we have to just floor it and hope it only eats some of us

I feel so bad for the grads who put in the hard work to get a masters in art and land a six figure job at one of the big art firms, only to have expectations crushed by dall-e

Need new bailout, Biden. Social contract has been violated

As children, adults tell us not to lie, and then we see them lie constantly. It took me a lot longer than most to understand what they really meant: only lie when you can get away with it. Lie well or don’t lie at all
------
A grandparent gives a crappy present. You tell the truth, and get in trouble for it. That time a lie was actually required. Most confusing
------
You’re scaring the hoes. I’m forming emotionally intimate relationships with the hoes. We are not the same
------
The elites don’t want you to know this, but you can talk about your true feelings with the bros too
------
I don't think I've ever fallen in love at first sight, but sometimes I see a face and instantly know that I could never love them
------
Well I can't see how this innovative COVID testing glory hole could possibly become its own porn genre.
------
Engineers don't owe you engines
------
I can accept "they" as a singular pronoun, but only if it is accompanied by the singular verb. For example: they is on their fifth white claw.
------
Bluechecks posting their wordle scores are the worst. Hey look everyone, I did pretty well at a total midwit game!
------
Biggest cultural different in tech cos right now is cameras on or cameras off meetings. I'm definitely a camera off guy. I have work to do this isn't Shahs of Sunset

Do you need your morning coffee or do you need to stop staying up until 2:30 doing a wiki deep dive on Stalin's career as a bank robber?
------
Spoiler alert: although the myth was widely promulgated, there's no evidence that Stalin actually robbed a bank or train
------
Lead emoji designer: No, that looks too much like an actual eggplant. We're designing the standin for the human male member here, make it more plump, juicy, and inviting!
------
You will never have all of your needs fulfilled by one person. If that's what you think a "soul mate" is, it is not going to happen. And that's completely ok
------
It's actually pretty touching when you know that large parts of you don't make sense to them, and they clearly care dearly anyhow. It's ok, she doesn't make sense to me either
------
When it comes to the parts she doesn't get, I find friends who share those interests. But do make sure your needs are met one way or another
------
A recession is a psychological phenomenon as much as it is an economic one. It usually doesn't end until the misery it caused has matched the exuberance of the previous upward trend. That's when people feel it's over
------
Granted, there are many real world factors at play in the economy today that have nothing to do with psychology: the droughts, disease. But the choice of when to start expanding again is still highly influenced by feelings
------
Whenever some dickhead blathering on about his home theater setup uses the words "more immersive" I immediately knee him in the balls
------
You know what's immersive? Not watching Fast and Furious movies is the cornerstone of my personal philosophy. It's not about having 9 speakers
------
Yeah if you want something done, ask a busy person. If it’s not really a priority, ask a guy who woke up at one and immediately turned on a playstation
------
Women, do you love She Hulk? Do you just love it? It's FOR YOU. If you don't love it then I don't even know what the point was
------
I watched it next to a woman, and she was on her phone the whole time. She couldn't pay attention for more than a minute at a time. Selling the OC captivates her.
------
What if Charles offers to be king of America too? Like just be king of all of it again? Kinda fun, right? He promises not to be all shitty about it like our last one
------
Real question is, who will be named King's Hand? This could be where bojo makes his move!
------
Corona fever dreams, night three. There is a war inside of me. No quarter is asked and none is given. Either this virus will consume me entire, or I will destroy it for good, for all mankind
------
King Charles like I finally won this game of thrones! 75 years of intricate plotting and scheming paid off!
------
Well I think corona finally got me. Fever 100. I’ll be fine. You are all awesome. 
*starts hallucinating, punches vanity mirror, the doors music plays*

I mean if I’m going to suffer obv I will milk for a few likes
------
You don’t have to eat food you don’t want to eat, ever. If someone insists they are the rude ones. Literally putting something inside of your body or not is a deeply personal choice.
------
Yeah, other people will get their feelings hurt by this. They’ll survive. Do it a few times and they will simply accept it.

I can’t even express how much better I felt in general when I instituted this policy.

If unruly AI was the only possible threat we faced, we might consider not moving forward with it, but we need superhuman machine learning to get us out of all the other jams we’re in, so we have to just floor it and hope it only eats some of us

I feel so bad for the grads who put in the hard work to get a masters in art and land a six figure job at one of the big art firms, only to have expectations crushed by dall-e

Need new bailout, Biden. Social contract has been violated

As children, adults tell us not to lie, and then we see them lie constantly. It took me a lot longer than most to understand what they really meant: only lie when you can get away with it. Lie well or don’t lie at all
------
A grandparent gives a crappy present. You tell the truth, and get in trouble for it. That time a lie was actually required. Most confusing
------
You’re scaring the hoes. I’m forming emotionally intimate relationships with the hoes. We are not the same
------
The elites don’t want you to know this, but you can talk about your true feelings with the bros too
------
I don't think I've ever fallen in love at first sight, but sometimes I see a face and instantly know that I could never love them
------
Well I can't see how this innovative COVID testing glory hole could possibly become its own porn genre.
------
Engineers don't owe you engines
------
I can accept "they" as a singular pronoun, but only if it is accompanied by the singular verb. For example: they is on their fifth white claw.
------
Bluechecks posting their wordle scores are the worst. Hey look everyone, I did pretty well at a total midwit game!
------
Biggest cultural different in tech cos right now is cameras on or cameras off meetings. I'm definitely a camera off guy. I have work to do this isn't Shahs of Sunset

Do you need your morning coffee or do you need to stop staying up until 2:30 doing a wiki deep dive on Stalin's career as a bank robber?
------
Spoiler alert: although the myth was widely promulgated, there's no evidence that Stalin actually robbed a bank or train
------
Lead emoji designer: No, that looks too much like an actual eggplant. We're designing the standin for the human male member here, make it more plump, juicy, and inviting!
------
You will never have all of your needs fulfilled by one person. If that's what you think a "soul mate" is, it is not going to happen. And that's completely ok
------
It's actually pretty touching when you know that large parts of you don't make sense to them, and they clearly care dearly anyhow. It's ok, she doesn't make sense to me either
------
When it comes to the parts she doesn't get, I find friends who share those interests. But do make sure your needs are met one way or another
------
A recession is a psychological phenomenon as much as it is an economic one. It usually doesn't end until the misery it caused has matched the exuberance of the previous upward trend. That's when people feel it's over
------
Granted, there are many real world factors at play in the economy today that have nothing to do with psychology: the droughts, disease. But the choice of when to start expanding again is still highly influenced by feelings
------
Whenever some dickhead blathering on about his home theater setup uses the words "more immersive" I immediately knee him in the balls
------
You know what's immersive? Not watching Fast and Furious movies is the cornerstone of my personal philosophy. It's not about having 9 speakers
------
Yeah if you want something done, ask a busy person. If it’s not really a priority, ask a guy who woke up at one and immediately turned on a playstation
------
Women, do you love She Hulk? Do you just love it? It's FOR YOU. If you don't love it then I don't even know what the point was
------
I watched it next to a woman, and she was on her phone the whole time. She couldn't pay attention for more than a minute at a time. Selling the OC captivates her.
------
What if Charles offers to be king of America too? Like just be king of all of it again? Kinda fun, right? He promises not to be all shitty about it like our last one
------
Real question is, who will be named King's Hand? This could be where bojo makes his move!
------
Corona fever dreams, night three. There is a war inside of me. No quarter is asked and none is given. Either this virus will consume me entire, or I will destroy it for good, for all mankind
------
King Charles like I finally won this game of thrones! 75 years of intricate plotting and scheming paid off!
------
Well I think corona finally got me. Fever 100. I’ll be fine. You are all awesome. 
*starts hallucinating, punches vanity mirror, the doors music plays*

I mean if I’m going to suffer obv I will milk for a few likes
------
You don’t have to eat food you don’t want to eat, ever. If someone insists they are the rude ones. Literally putting something inside of your body or not is a deeply personal choice.
------
Yeah, other people will get their feelings hurt by this. They’ll survive. Do it a few times and they will simply accept it.

I can’t even express how much better I felt in general when I instituted this policy.

If unruly AI was the only possible threat we faced, we might consider not moving forward with it, but we need superhuman machine learning to get us out of all the other jams we’re in, so we have to just floor it and hope it only eats some of us

I feel so bad for the grads who put in the hard work to get a masters in art and land a six figure job at one of the big art firms, only to have expectations crushed by dall-e

Need new bailout, Biden. Social contract has been violated

As children, adults tell us not to lie, and then we see them lie constantly. It took me a lot longer than most to understand what they really meant: only lie when you can get away with it. Lie well or don’t lie at all
------
A grandparent gives a crappy present. You tell the truth, and get in trouble for it. That time a lie was actually required. Most confusing
------
You’re scaring the hoes. I’m forming emotionally intimate relationships with the hoes. We are not the same
------
The elites don’t want you to know this, but you can talk about your true feelings with the bros too
------
I don't think I've ever fallen in love at first sight, but sometimes I see a face and instantly know that I could never love them
------
Well I can't see how this innovative COVID testing glory hole could possibly become its own porn genre.
------
Engineers don't owe you engines
------
I can accept "they" as a singular pronoun, but only if it is accompanied by the singular verb. For example: they is on their fifth white claw.
------
Bluechecks posting their wordle scores are the worst. Hey look everyone, I did pretty well at a total midwit game!
------
Biggest cultural different in tech cos right now is cameras on or cameras off meetings. I'm definitely a camera off guy. I have work to do this isn't Shahs of Sunset

Do you need your morning coffee or do you need to stop staying up until 2:30 doing a wiki deep dive on Stalin's career as a bank robber?
------
Spoiler alert: although the myth was widely promulgated, there's no evidence that Stalin actually robbed a bank or train
------
Lead emoji designer: No, that looks too much like an actual eggplant. We're designing the standin for the human male member here, make it more plump, juicy, and inviting!
------
You will never have all of your needs fulfilled by one person. If that's what you think a "soul mate" is, it is not going to happen. And that's completely ok
------
It's actually pretty touching when you know that large parts of you don't make sense to them, and they clearly care dearly anyhow. It's ok, she doesn't make sense to me either
------
When it comes to the parts she doesn't get, I find friends who share those interests. But do make sure your needs are met one way or another
------
A recession is a psychological phenomenon as much as it is an economic one. It usually doesn't end until the misery it caused has matched the exuberance of the previous upward trend. That's when people feel it's over
------
Granted, there are many real world factors at play in the economy today that have nothing to do with psychology: the droughts, disease. But the choice of when to start expanding again is still highly influenced by feelings
------
Whenever some dickhead blathering on about his home theater setup uses the words "more immersive" I immediately knee him in the balls
------
You know what's immersive? Not watching Fast and Furious movies is the cornerstone of my personal philosophy. It's not about having 9 speakers
------
Yeah if you want something done, ask a busy person. If it’s not really a priority, ask a guy who woke up at one and immediately turned on a playstation
------
Women, do you love She Hulk? Do you just love it? It's FOR YOU. If you don't love it then I don't even know what the point was
------
I watched it next to a woman, and she was on her phone the whole time. She couldn't pay attention for more than a minute at a time. Selling the OC captivates her.
------
What if Charles offers to be king of America too? Like just be king of all of it again? Kinda fun, right? He promises not to be all shitty about it like our last one
------
Real question is, who will be named King's Hand? This could be where bojo makes his move!
------
Corona fever dreams, night three. There is a war inside of me. No quarter is asked and none is given. Either this virus will consume me entire, or I will destroy it for good, for all mankind
------
King Charles like I finally won this game of thrones! 75 years of intricate plotting and scheming paid off!
------
Well I think corona finally got me. Fever 100. I’ll be fine. You are all awesome. 
*starts hallucinating, punches vanity mirror, the doors music plays*

I mean if I’m going to suffer obv I will milk for a few likes
------
You don’t have to eat food you don’t want to eat, ever. If someone insists they are the rude ones. Literally putting something inside of your body or not is a deeply personal choice.
------
Yeah, other people will get their feelings hurt by this. They’ll survive. Do it a few times and they will simply accept it.

I can’t even express how much better I felt in general when I instituted this policy.

If unruly AI was the only possible threat we faced, we might consider not moving forward with it, but we need superhuman machine learning to get us out of all the other jams we’re in, so we have to just floor it and hope it only eats some of us

I feel so bad for the grads who put in the hard work to get a masters in art and land a six figure job at one of the big art firms, only to have expectations crushed by dall-e

Need new bailout, Biden. Social contract has been violated

As children, adults tell us not to lie, and then we see them lie constantly. It took me a lot longer than most to understand what they really meant: only lie when you can get away with it. Lie well or don’t lie at all
------
A grandparent gives a crappy present. You tell the truth, and get in trouble for it. That time a lie was actually required. Most confusing
------
You’re scaring the hoes. I’m forming emotionally intimate relationships with the hoes. We are not the same
------
The elites don’t want you to know this, but you can talk about your true feelings with the bros too
------
I don't think I've ever fallen in love at first sight, but sometimes I see a face and instantly know that I could never love them
------
Well I can't see how this innovative COVID testing glory hole could possibly become its own porn genre.
------
Engineers don't owe you engines
------
I can accept "they" as a singular pronoun, but only if it is accompanied by the singular verb. For example: they is on their fifth white claw.
------
Bluechecks posting their wordle scores are the worst. Hey look everyone, I did pretty well at a total midwit game!
------
Biggest cultural different in tech cos right now is cameras on or cameras off meetings. I'm definitely a camera off guy. I have work to do this isn't Shahs of Sunset

Do you need your morning coffee or do you need to stop staying up until 2:30 doing a wiki deep dive on Stalin's career as a bank robber?
------
Spoiler alert: although the myth was widely promulgated, there's no evidence that Stalin actually robbed a bank or train
------
Lead emoji designer: No, that looks too much like an actual eggplant. We're designing the standin for the human male member here, make it more plump, juicy, and inviting!
------
You will never have all of your needs fulfilled by one person. If that's what you think a "soul mate" is, it is not going to happen. And that's completely ok
------
It's actually pretty touching when you know that large parts of you don't make sense to them, and they clearly care dearly anyhow. It's ok, she doesn't make sense to me either
------
When it comes to the parts she doesn't get, I find friends who share those interests. But do make sure your needs are met one way or another
------
A recession is a psychological phenomenon as much as it is an economic one. It usually doesn't end until the misery it caused has matched the exuberance of the previous upward trend. That's when people feel it's over
------
Granted, there are many real world factors at play in the economy today that have nothing to do with psychology: the droughts, disease. But the choice of when to start expanding again is still highly influenced by feelings
------
Whenever some dickhead blathering on about his home theater setup uses the words "more immersive" I immediately knee him in the balls
------
You know what's immersive? Not watching Fast and Furious movies is the cornerstone of my personal philosophy. It's not about having 9 speakers
------
Yeah if you want something done, ask a busy person. If it’s not really a priority, ask a guy who woke up at one and immediately turned on a playstation
------
Women, do you love She Hulk? Do you just love it? It's FOR YOU. If you don't love it then I don't even know what the point was
------
I watched it next to a woman, and she was on her phone the whole time. She couldn't pay attention for more than a minute at a time. Selling the OC captivates her.
------
What if Charles offers to be king of America too? Like just be king of all of it again? Kinda fun, right? He promises not to be all shitty about it like our last one
------
Real question is, who will be named King's Hand? This could be where bojo makes his move!
------
Corona fever dreams, night three. There is a war inside of me. No quarter is asked and none is given. Either this virus will consume me entire, or I will destroy it for good, for all mankind
------
King Charles like I finally won this game of thrones! 75 years of intricate plotting and scheming paid off!
------
Well I think corona finally got me. Fever 100. I’ll be fine. You are all awesome. 
*starts hallucinating, punches vanity mirror, the doors music plays*

I mean if I’m going to suffer obv I will milk for a few likes
------
You don’t have to eat food you don’t want to eat, ever. If someone insists they are the rude ones. Literally putting something inside of your body or not is a deeply personal choice.
------
Yeah, other people will get their feelings hurt by this. They’ll survive. Do it a few times and they will simply accept it.

I can’t even express how much better I felt in general when I instituted this policy.

If unruly AI was the only possible threat we faced, we might consider not moving forward with it, but we need superhuman machine learning to get us out of all the other jams we’re in, so we have to just floor it and hope it only eats some of us

I feel so bad for the grads who put in the hard work to get a masters in art and land a six figure job at one of the big art firms, only to have expectations crushed by dall-e

Need new bailout, Biden. Social contract has been violated

As children, adults tell us not to lie, and then we see them lie constantly. It took me a lot longer than most to understand what they really meant: only lie when you can get away with it. Lie well or don’t lie at all
------
A grandparent gives a crappy present. You tell the truth, and get in trouble for it. That time a lie was actually required. Most confusing
------
You’re scaring the hoes. I’m forming emotionally intimate relationships with the hoes. We are not the same
------
The elites don’t want you to know this, but you can talk about your true feelings with the bros too
------
I don't think I've ever fallen in love at first sight, but sometimes I see a face and instantly know that I could never love them
------
Well I can't see how this innovative COVID testing glory hole could possibly become its own porn genre.
------
Engineers don't owe you engines
------
I can accept "they" as a singular pronoun, but only if it is accompanied by the singular verb. For example: they is on their fifth white claw.
------
Bluechecks posting their wordle scores are the worst. Hey look everyone, I did pretty well at a total midwit game!
------
Biggest cultural different in tech cos right now is cameras on or cameras off meetings. I'm definitely a camera off guy. I have work to do this isn't Shahs of Sunset

Do you need your morning coffee or do you need to stop staying up until 2:30 doing a wiki deep dive on Stalin's career as a bank robber?
------
Spoiler alert: although the myth was widely promulgated, there's no evidence that Stalin actually robbed a bank or train
------
Lead emoji designer: No, that looks too much like an actual eggplant. We're designing the standin for the human male member here, make it more plump, juicy, and inviting!
------
You will never have all of your needs fulfilled by one person. If that's what you think a "soul mate" is, it is not going to happen. And that's completely ok
------
It's actually pretty touching when you know that large parts of you don't make sense to them, and they clearly care dearly anyhow. It's ok, she doesn't make sense to me either
------
When it comes to the parts she doesn't get, I find friends who share those interests. But do make sure your needs are met one way or another
------
A recession is a psychological phenomenon as much as it is an economic one. It usually doesn't end until the misery it caused has matched the exuberance of the previous upward trend. That's when people feel it's over
------
Granted, there are many real world factors at play in the economy today that have nothing to do with psychology: the droughts, disease. But the choice of when to start expanding again is still highly influenced by feelings
------
Whenever some dickhead blathering on about his home theater setup uses the words "more immersive" I immediately knee him in the balls
------
You know what's immersive? Not watching Fast and Furious movies is the cornerstone of my personal philosophy. It's not about having 9 speakers
------
Yeah if you want something done, ask a busy person. If it’s not really a priority, ask a guy who woke up at one and immediately turned on a playstation
------
Women, do you love She Hulk? Do you just love it? It's FOR YOU. If you don't love it then I don't even know what the point was
------
I watched it next to a woman, and she was on her phone the whole time. She couldn't pay attention for more than a minute at a time. Selling the OC captivates her.
------
What if Charles offers to be king of America too? Like just be king of all of it again? Kinda fun, right? He promises not to be all shitty about it like our last one
------
Real question is, who will be named King's Hand? This could be where bojo makes his move!
------
Corona fever dreams, night three. There is a war inside of me. No quarter is asked and none is given. Either this virus will consume me entire, or I will destroy it for good, for all mankind
------
King Charles like I finally won this game of thrones! 75 years of intricate plotting and scheming paid off!
------
Well I think corona finally got me. Fever 100. I’ll be fine. You are all awesome. 
*starts hallucinating, punches vanity mirror, the doors music plays*

I mean if I’m going to suffer obv I will milk for a few likes
------
You don’t have to eat food you don’t want to eat, ever. If someone insists they are the rude ones. Literally putting something inside of your body or not is a deeply personal choice.
------
Yeah, other people will get their feelings hurt by this. They’ll survive. Do it a few times and they will simply accept it.

I can’t even express how much better I felt in general when I instituted this policy.

If unruly AI was the only possible threat we faced, we might consider not moving forward with it, but we need superhuman machine learning to get us out of all the other jams we’re in, so we have to just floor it and hope it only eats some of us

I feel so bad for the grads who put in the hard work to get a masters in art and land a six figure job at one of the big art firms, only to have expectations crushed by dall-e

Need new bailout, Biden. Social contract has been violated

As children, adults tell us not to lie, and then we see them lie constantly. It took me a lot longer than most to understand what they really meant: only lie when you can get away with it. Lie well or don’t lie at all
------
A grandparent gives a crappy present. You tell the truth, and get in trouble for it. That time a lie was actually required. Most confusing
------
You’re scaring the hoes. I’m forming emotionally intimate relationships with the hoes. We are not the same
------
The elites don’t want you to know this, but you can talk about your true feelings with the bros too
------
I don't think I've ever fallen in love at first sight, but sometimes I see a face and instantly know that I could never love them
------
Well I can't see how this innovative COVID testing glory hole could possibly become its own porn genre.
------
Engineers don't owe you engines
------
I can accept "they" as a singular pronoun, but only if it is accompanied by the singular verb. For example: they is on their fifth white claw.
------
Bluechecks posting their wordle scores are the worst. Hey look everyone, I did pretty well at a total midwit game!
------
Biggest cultural different in tech cos right now is cameras on or cameras off meetings. I'm definitely a camera off guy. I have work to do this isn't Shahs of Sunset

Do you need your morning coffee or do you need to stop staying up until 2:30 doing a wiki deep dive on Stalin's career as a bank robber?
------
Spoiler alert: although the myth was widely promulgated, there's no evidence that Stalin actually robbed a bank or train
------
Lead emoji designer: No, that looks too much like an actual eggplant. We're designing the standin for the human male member here, make it more plump, juicy, and inviting!
------
You will never have all of your needs fulfilled by one person. If that's what you think a "soul mate" is, it is not going to happen. And that's completely ok
------
It's actually pretty touching when you know that large parts of you don't make sense to them, and they clearly care dearly anyhow. It's ok, she doesn't make sense to me either
------
When it comes to the parts she doesn't get, I find friends who share those interests. But do make sure your needs are met one way or another
------
A recession is a psychological phenomenon as much as it is an economic one. It usually doesn't end until the misery it caused has matched the exuberance of the previous upward trend. That's when people feel it's over
------
Granted, there are many real world factors at play in the economy today that have nothing to do with psychology: the droughts, disease. But the choice of when to start expanding again is still highly influenced by feelings
------
Whenever some dickhead blathering on about his home theater setup uses the words "more immersive" I immediately knee him in the balls
------
You know what's immersive? Not watching Fast and Furious movies is the cornerstone of my personal philosophy. It's not about having 9 speakers
------
Yeah if you want something done, ask a busy person. If it’s not really a priority, ask a guy who woke up at one and immediately turned on a playstation
------
Women, do you love She Hulk? Do you just love it? It's FOR YOU. If you don't love it then I don't even know what the point was
------
I watched it next to a woman, and she was on her phone the whole time. She couldn't pay attention for more than a minute at a time. Selling the OC captivates her.
------
What if Charles offers to be king of America too? Like just be king of all of it again? Kinda fun, right? He promises not to be all shitty about it like our last one
------
Real question is, who will be named King's Hand? This could be where bojo makes his move!
------
Corona fever dreams, night three. There is a war inside of me. No quarter is asked and none is given. Either this virus will consume me entire, or I will destroy it for good, for all mankind
------
King Charles like I finally won this game of thrones! 75 years of intricate plotting and scheming paid off!
------
Well I think corona finally got me. Fever 100. I’ll be fine. You are all awesome. 
*starts hallucinating, punches vanity mirror, the doors music plays*

I mean if I’m going to suffer obv I will milk for a few likes
------
You don’t have to eat food you don’t want to eat, ever. If someone insists they are the rude ones. Literally putting something inside of your body or not is a deeply personal choice.
------
Yeah, other people will get their feelings hurt by this. They’ll survive. Do it a few times and they will simply accept it.

I can’t even express how much better I felt in general when I instituted this policy.

If unruly AI was the only possible threat we faced, we might consider not moving forward with it, but we need superhuman machine learning to get us out of all the other jams we’re in, so we have to just floor it and hope it only eats some of us

I feel so bad for the grads who put in the hard work to get a masters in art and land a six figure job at one of the big art firms, only to have expectations crushed by dall-e

Need new bailout, Biden. Social contract has been violated

As children, adults tell us not to lie, and then we see them lie constantly. It took me a lot longer than most to understand what they really meant: only lie when you can get away with it. Lie well or don’t lie at all
------
A grandparent gives a crappy present. You tell the truth, and get in trouble for it. That time a lie was actually required. Most confusing
------
You’re scaring the hoes. I’m forming emotionally intimate relationships with the hoes. We are not the same
------
The elites don’t want you to know this, but you can talk about your true feelings with the bros too
------
I don't think I've ever fallen in love at first sight, but sometimes I see a face and instantly know that I could never love them
------
Well I can't see how this innovative COVID testing glory hole could possibly become its own porn genre.
------
Engineers don't owe you engines
------
I can accept "they" as a singular pronoun, but only if it is accompanied by the singular verb. For example: they is on their fifth white claw.
------
Bluechecks posting their wordle scores are the worst. Hey look everyone, I did pretty well at a total midwit game!
------
Biggest cultural different in tech cos right now is cameras on or cameras off meetings. I'm definitely a camera off guy. I have work to do this isn't Shahs of Sunset

Do you need your morning coffee or do you need to stop staying up until 2:30 doing a wiki deep dive on Stalin's career as a bank robber?
------
Spoiler alert: although the myth was widely promulgated, there's no evidence that Stalin actually robbed a bank or train
------
Lead emoji designer: No, that looks too much like an actual eggplant. We're designing the standin for the human male member here, make it more plump, juicy, and inviting!
------
You will never have all of your needs fulfilled by one person. If that's what you think a "soul mate" is, it is not going to happen. And that's completely ok
------
It's actually pretty touching when you know that large parts of you don't make sense to them, and they clearly care dearly anyhow. It's ok, she doesn't make sense to me either
------
When it comes to the parts she doesn't get, I find friends who share those interests. But do make sure your needs are met one way or another
------
A recession is a psychological phenomenon as much as it is an economic one. It usually doesn't end until the misery it caused has matched the exuberance of the previous upward trend. That's when people feel it's over
------
Granted, there are many real world factors at play in the economy today that have nothing to do with psychology: the droughts, disease. But the choice of when to start expanding again is still highly influenced by feelings
------
Whenever some dickhead blathering on about his home theater setup uses the words "more immersive" I immediately knee him in the balls
------
You know what's immersive? Not watching Fast and Furious movies is the cornerstone of my personal philosophy. It's not about having 9 speakers
------
Yeah if you want something done, ask a busy person. If it’s not really a priority, ask a guy who woke up at one and immediately turned on a playstation
------
Women, do you love She Hulk? Do you just love it? It's FOR YOU. If you don't love it then I don't even know what the point was
------
I watched it next to a woman, and she was on her phone the whole time. She couldn't pay attention for more than a minute at a time. Selling the OC captivates her.
------
What if Charles offers to be king of America too? Like just be king of all of it again? Kinda fun, right? He promises not to be all shitty about it like our last one
------
Real question is, who will be named King's Hand? This could be where bojo makes his move!
------
Corona fever dreams, night three. There is a war inside of me. No quarter is asked and none is given. Either this virus will consume me entire, or I will destroy it for good, for all mankind
------
King Charles like I finally won this game of thrones! 75 years of intricate plotting and scheming paid off!
------
Well I think corona finally got me. Fever 100. I’ll be fine. You are all awesome. 
*starts hallucinating, punches vanity mirror, the doors music plays*

I mean if I’m going to suffer obv I will milk for a few likes
------
You don’t have to eat food you don’t want to eat, ever. If someone insists they are the rude ones. Literally putting something inside of your body or not is a deeply personal choice.
------
Yeah, other people will get their feelings hurt by this. They’ll survive. Do it a few times and they will simply accept it.

I can’t even express how much better I felt in general when I instituted this policy.

If unruly AI was the only possible threat we faced, we might consider not moving forward with it, but we need superhuman machine learning to get us out of all the other jams we’re in, so we have to just floor it and hope it only eats some of us

I feel so bad for the grads who put in the hard work to get a masters in art and land a six figure job at one of the big art firms, only to have expectations crushed by dall-e

Need new bailout, Biden. Social contract has been violated

As children, adults tell us not to lie, and then we see them lie constantly. It took me a lot longer than most to understand what they really meant: only lie when you can get away with it. Lie well or don’t lie at all
------
A grandparent gives a crappy present. You tell the truth, and get in trouble for it. That time a lie was actually required. Most confusing
------
You’re scaring the hoes. I’m forming emotionally intimate relationships with the hoes. We are not the same
------
The elites don’t want you to know this, but you can talk about your true feelings with the bros too
------
I don't think I've ever fallen in love at first sight, but sometimes I see a face and instantly know that I could never love them
------
Well I can't see how this innovative COVID testing glory hole could possibly become its own porn genre.
------
Engineers don't owe you engines
------
I can accept "they" as a singular pronoun, but only if it is accompanied by the singular verb. For example: they is on their fifth white claw.
------
Bluechecks posting their wordle scores are the worst. Hey look everyone, I did pretty well at a total midwit game!
------
Biggest cultural different in tech cos right now is cameras on or cameras off meetings. I'm definitely a camera off guy. I have work to do this isn't Shahs of Sunset

Do you need your morning coffee or do you need to stop staying up until 2:30 doing a wiki deep dive on Stalin's career as a bank robber?
------
Spoiler alert: although the myth was widely promulgated, there's no evidence that Stalin actually robbed a bank or train
------
Lead emoji designer: No, that looks too much like an actual eggplant. We're designing the standin for the human male member here, make it more plump, juicy, and inviting!
------
You will never have all of your needs fulfilled by one person. If that's what you think a "soul mate" is, it is not going to happen. And that's completely ok
------
It's actually pretty touching when you know that large parts of you don't make sense to them, and they clearly care dearly anyhow. It's ok, she doesn't make sense to me either
------
When it comes to the parts she doesn't get, I find friends who share those interests. But do make sure your needs are met one way or another
------
A recession is a psychological phenomenon as much as it is an economic one. It usually doesn't end until the misery it caused has matched the exuberance of the previous upward trend. That's when people feel it's over
------
Granted, there are many real world factors at play in the economy today that have nothing to do with psychology: the droughts, disease. But the choice of when to start expanding again is still highly influenced by feelings
------
Whenever some dickhead blathering on about his home theater setup uses the words "more immersive" I immediately knee him in the balls
------
You know what's immersive? Not watching Fast and Furious movies is the cornerstone of my personal philosophy. It's not about having 9 speakers
------
Yeah if you want something done, ask a busy person. If it’s not really a priority, ask a guy who woke up at one and immediately turned on a playstation
------
Women, do you love She Hulk? Do you just love it? It's FOR YOU. If you don't love it then I don't even know what the point was
------
I watched it next to a woman, and she was on her phone the whole time. She couldn't pay attention for more than a minute at a time. Selling the OC captivates her.
------
What if Charles offers to be king of America too? Like just be king of all of it again? Kinda fun, right? He promises not to be all shitty about it like our last one
------
Real question is, who will be named King's Hand? This could be where bojo makes his move!
------
Corona fever dreams, night three. There is a war inside of me. No quarter is asked and none is given. Either this virus will consume me entire, or I will destroy it for good, for all mankind
------
King Charles like I finally won this game of thrones! 75 years of intricate plotting and scheming paid off!
------
Well I think corona finally got me. Fever 100. I’ll be fine. You are all awesome. 
*starts hallucinating, punches vanity mirror, the doors music plays*

I mean if I’m going to suffer obv I will milk for a few likes
------
You don’t have to eat food you don’t want to eat, ever. If someone insists they are the rude ones. Literally putting something inside of your body or not is a deeply personal choice.
------
Yeah, other people will get their feelings hurt by this. They’ll survive. Do it a few times and they will simply accept it.

I can’t even express how much better I felt in general when I instituted this policy.

If unruly AI was the only possible threat we faced, we might consider not moving forward with it, but we need superhuman machine learning to get us out of all the other jams we’re in, so we have to just floor it and hope it only eats some of us

I feel so bad for the grads who put in the hard work to get a masters in art and land a six figure job at one of the big art firms, only to have expectations crushed by dall-e

Need new bailout, Biden. Social contract has been violated

As children, adults tell us not to lie, and then we see them lie constantly. It took me a lot longer than most to understand what they really meant: only lie when you can get away with it. Lie well or don’t lie at all
------
A grandparent gives a crappy present. You tell the truth, and get in trouble for it. That time a lie was actually required. Most confusing
------
You’re scaring the hoes. I’m forming emotionally intimate relationships with the hoes. We are not the same
------
The elites don’t want you to know this, but you can talk about your true feelings with the bros too
------
I don't think I've ever fallen in love at first sight, but sometimes I see a face and instantly know that I could never love them
------
Well I can't see how this innovative COVID testing glory hole could possibly become its own porn genre.
------
Engineers don't owe you engines
------
I can accept "they" as a singular pronoun, but only if it is accompanied by the singular verb. For example: they is on their fifth white claw.
------
Bluechecks posting their wordle scores are the worst. Hey look everyone, I did pretty well at a total midwit game!
------
Biggest cultural different in tech cos right now is cameras on or cameras off meetings. I'm definitely a camera off guy. I have work to do this isn't Shahs of Sunset

Do you need your morning coffee or do you need to stop staying up until 2:30 doing a wiki deep dive on Stalin's career as a bank robber?
------
Spoiler alert: although the myth was widely promulgated, there's no evidence that Stalin actually robbed a bank or train
------
Lead emoji designer: No, that looks too much like an actual eggplant. We're designing the standin for the human male member here, make it more plump, juicy, and inviting!
------
You will never have all of your needs fulfilled by one person. If that's what you think a "soul mate" is, it is not going to happen. And that's completely ok
------
It's actually pretty touching when you know that large parts of you don't make sense to them, and they clearly care dearly anyhow. It's ok, she doesn't make sense to me either
------
When it comes to the parts she doesn't get, I find friends who share those interests. But do make sure your needs are met one way or another
------
A recession is a psychological phenomenon as much as it is an economic one. It usually doesn't end until the misery it caused has matched the exuberance of the previous upward trend. That's when people feel it's over
------
Granted, there are many real world factors at play in the economy today that have nothing to do with psychology: the droughts, disease. But the choice of when to start expanding again is still highly influenced by feelings
------
Whenever some dickhead blathering on about his home theater setup uses the words "more immersive" I immediately knee him in the balls
------
You know what's immersive? Not watching Fast and Furious movies is the cornerstone of my personal philosophy. It's not about having 9 speakers
------
Yeah if you want something done, ask a busy person. If it’s not really a priority, ask a guy who woke up at one and immediately turned on a playstation
------
Women, do you love She Hulk? Do you just love it? It's FOR YOU. If you don't love it then I don't even know what the point was
------
I watched it next to a woman, and she was on her phone the whole time. She couldn't pay attention for more than a minute at a time. Selling the OC captivates her.
------
What if Charles offers to be king of America too? Like just be king of all of it again? Kinda fun, right? He promises not to be all shitty about it like our last one
------
Real question is, who will be named King's Hand? This could be where bojo makes his move!
------
Corona fever dreams, night three. There is a war inside of me. No quarter is asked and none is given. Either this virus will consume me entire, or I will destroy it for good, for all mankind
------
King Charles like I finally won this game of thrones! 75 years of intricate plotting and scheming paid off!
------
Well I think corona finally got me. Fever 100. I’ll be fine. You are all awesome. 
*starts hallucinating, punches vanity mirror, the doors music plays*

I mean if I’m going to suffer obv I will milk for a few likes
------
You don’t have to eat food you don’t want to eat, ever. If someone insists they are the rude ones. Literally putting something inside of your body or not is a deeply personal choice.
------
Yeah, other people will get their feelings hurt by this. They’ll survive. Do it a few times and they will simply accept it.

I can’t even express how much better I felt in general when I instituted this policy.

If unruly AI was the only possible threat we faced, we might consider not moving forward with it, but we need superhuman machine learning to get us out of all the other jams we’re in, so we have to just floor it and hope it only eats some of us

I feel so bad for the grads who put in the hard work to get a masters in art and land a six figure job at one of the big art firms, only to have expectations crushed by dall-e

Need new bailout, Biden. Social contract has been violated

As children, adults tell us not to lie, and then we see them lie constantly. It took me a lot longer than most to understand what they really meant: only lie when you can get away with it. Lie well or don’t lie at all
------
A grandparent gives a crappy present. You tell the truth, and get in trouble for it. That time a lie was actually required. Most confusing
------
You’re scaring the hoes. I’m forming emotionally intimate relationships with the hoes. We are not the same
------
The elites don’t want you to know this, but you can talk about your true feelings with the bros too
------
I don't think I've ever fallen in love at first sight, but sometimes I see a face and instantly know that I could never love them
------
Well I can't see how this innovative COVID testing glory hole could possibly become its own porn genre.
------
Engineers don't owe you engines
------
I can accept "they" as a singular pronoun, but only if it is accompanied by the singular verb. For example: they is on their fifth white claw.
------
Bluechecks posting their wordle scores are the worst. Hey look everyone, I did pretty well at a total midwit game!
------
Biggest cultural different in tech cos right now is cameras on or cameras off meetings. I'm definitely a camera off guy. I have work to do this isn't Shahs of Sunset

Do you need your morning coffee or do you need to stop staying up until 2:30 doing a wiki deep dive on Stalin's career as a bank robber?
------
Spoiler alert: although the myth was widely promulgated, there's no evidence that Stalin actually robbed a bank or train
------
Lead emoji designer: No, that looks too much like an actual eggplant. We're designing the standin for the human male member here, make it more plump, juicy, and inviting!
------
You will never have all of your needs fulfilled by one person. If that's what you think a "soul mate" is, it is not going to happen. And that's completely ok
------
It's actually pretty touching when you know that large parts of you don't make sense to them, and they clearly care dearly anyhow. It's ok, she doesn't make sense to me either
------
When it comes to the parts she doesn't get, I find friends who share those interests. But do make sure your needs are met one way or another
------
A recession is a psychological phenomenon as much as it is an economic one. It usually doesn't end until the misery it caused has matched the exuberance of the previous upward trend. That's when people feel it's over
------
Granted, there are many real world factors at play in the economy today that have nothing to do with psychology: the droughts, disease. But the choice of when to start expanding again is still highly influenced by feelings
------
Whenever some dickhead blathering on about his home theater setup uses the words "more immersive" I immediately knee him in the balls
------
You know what's immersive? Not watching Fast and Furious movies is the cornerstone of my personal philosophy. It's not about having 9 speakers
------
Yeah if you want something done, ask a busy person. If it’s not really a priority, ask a guy who woke up at one and immediately turned on a playstation
------
Women, do you love She Hulk? Do you just love it? It's FOR YOU. If you don't love it then I don't even know what the point was
------
I watched it next to a woman, and she was on her phone the whole time. She couldn't pay attention for more than a minute at a time. Selling the OC captivates her.
------
What if Charles offers to be king of America too? Like just be king of all of it again? Kinda fun, right? He promises not to be all shitty about it like our last one
------
Real question is, who will be named King's Hand? This could be where bojo makes his move!
------
Corona fever dreams, night three. There is a war inside of me. No quarter is asked and none is given. Either this virus will consume me entire, or I will destroy it for good, for all mankind
------
King Charles like I finally won this game of thrones! 75 years of intricate plotting and scheming paid off!
------
Well I think corona finally got me. Fever 100. I’ll be fine. You are all awesome. 
*starts hallucinating, punches vanity mirror, the doors music plays*

I mean if I’m going to suffer obv I will milk for a few likes
------
You don’t have to eat food you don’t want to eat, ever. If someone insists they are the rude ones. Literally putting something inside of your body or not is a deeply personal choice.
------
Yeah, other people will get their feelings hurt by this. They’ll survive. Do it a few times and they will simply accept it.

I can’t even express how much better I felt in general when I instituted this policy.

If unruly AI was the only possible threat we faced, we might consider not moving forward with it, but we need superhuman machine learning to get us out of all the other jams we’re in, so we have to just floor it and hope it only eats some of us

I feel so bad for the grads who put in the hard work to get a masters in art and land a six figure job at one of the big art firms, only to have expectations crushed by dall-e

Need new bailout, Biden. Social contract has been violated

As children, adults tell us not to lie, and then we see them lie constantly. It took me a lot longer than most to understand what they really meant: only lie when you can get away with it. Lie well or don’t lie at all
------
A grandparent gives a crappy present. You tell the truth, and get in trouble for it. That time a lie was actually required. Most confusing
------
You’re scaring the hoes. I’m forming emotionally intimate relationships with the hoes. We are not the same
------
The elites don’t want you to know this, but you can talk about your true feelings with the bros too
------
I don't think I've ever fallen in love at first sight, but sometimes I see a face and instantly know that I could never love them
------
Well I can't see how this innovative COVID testing glory hole could possibly become its own porn genre.
------
Engineers don't owe you engines
------
I can accept "they" as a singular pronoun, but only if it is accompanied by the singular verb. For example: they is on their fifth white claw.
------
Bluechecks posting their wordle scores are the worst. Hey look everyone, I did pretty well at a total midwit game!
------
Biggest cultural different in tech cos right now is cameras on or cameras off meetings. I'm definitely a camera off guy. I have work to do this isn't Shahs of Sunset

Do you need your morning coffee or do you need to stop staying up until 2:30 doing a wiki deep dive on Stalin's career as a bank robber?
------
Spoiler alert: although the myth was widely promulgated, there's no evidence that Stalin actually robbed a bank or train
------
Lead emoji designer: No, that looks too much like an actual eggplant. We're designing the standin for the human male member here, make it more plump, juicy, and inviting!
------
You will never have all of your needs fulfilled by one person. If that's what you think a "soul mate" is, it is not going to happen. And that's completely ok
------
It's actually pretty touching when you know that large parts of you don't make sense to them, and they clearly care dearly anyhow. It's ok, she doesn't make sense to me either
------
When it comes to the parts she doesn't get, I find friends who share those interests. But do make sure your needs are met one way or another
------
A recession is a psychological phenomenon as much as it is an economic one. It usually doesn't end until the misery it caused has matched the exuberance of the previous upward trend. That's when people feel it's over
------
Granted, there are many real world factors at play in the economy today that have nothing to do with psychology: the droughts, disease. But the choice of when to start expanding again is still highly influenced by feelings
------
Whenever some dickhead blathering on about his home theater setup uses the words "more immersive" I immediately knee him in the balls
------
You know what's immersive? Not watching Fast and Furious movies is the cornerstone of my personal philosophy. It's not about having 9 speakers
------
Yeah if you want something done, ask a busy person. If it’s not really a priority, ask a guy who woke up at one and immediately turned on a playstation
------
Women, do you love She Hulk? Do you just love it? It's FOR YOU. If you don't love it then I don't even know what the point was
------
I watched it next to a woman, and she was on her phone the whole time. She couldn't pay attention for more than a minute at a time. Selling the OC captivates her.
------
What if Charles offers to be king of America too? Like just be king of all of it again? Kinda fun, right? He promises not to be all shitty about it like our last one
------
Real question is, who will be named King's Hand? This could be where bojo makes his move!
------
Corona fever dreams, night three. There is a war inside of me. No quarter is asked and none is given. Either this virus will consume me entire, or I will destroy it for good, for all mankind
------
King Charles like I finally won this game of thrones! 75 years of intricate plotting and scheming paid off!
------
Well I think corona finally got me. Fever 100. I’ll be fine. You are all awesome. 
*starts hallucinating, punches vanity mirror, the doors music plays*

I mean if I’m going to suffer obv I will milk for a few likes
------
You don’t have to eat food you don’t want to eat, ever. If someone insists they are the rude ones. Literally putting something inside of your body or not is a deeply personal choice.
------
Yeah, other people will get their feelings hurt by this. They’ll survive. Do it a few times and they will simply accept it.

I can’t even express how much better I felt in general when I instituted this policy.

If unruly AI was the only possible threat we faced, we might consider not moving forward with it, but we need superhuman machine learning to get us out of all the other jams we’re in, so we have to just floor it and hope it only eats some of us

I feel so bad for the grads who put in the hard work to get a masters in art and land a six figure job at one of the big art firms, only to have expectations crushed by dall-e

Need new bailout, Biden. Social contract has been violated

As children, adults tell us not to lie, and then we see them lie constantly. It took me a lot longer than most to understand what they really meant: only lie when you can get away with it. Lie well or don’t lie at all
------
A grandparent gives a crappy present. You tell the truth, and get in trouble for it. That time a lie was actually required. Most confusing
------
You’re scaring the hoes. I’m forming emotionally intimate relationships with the hoes. We are not the same
------
The elites don’t want you to know this, but you can talk about your true feelings with the bros too
------
I don't think I've ever fallen in love at first sight, but sometimes I see a face and instantly know that I could never love them
------
Well I can't see how this innovative COVID testing glory hole could possibly become its own porn genre.
------
Engineers don't owe you engines
------
I can accept "they" as a singular pronoun, but only if it is accompanied by the singular verb. For example: they is on their fifth white claw.
------
Bluechecks posting their wordle scores are the worst. Hey look everyone, I did pretty well at a total midwit game!
------
Biggest cultural different in tech cos right now is cameras on or cameras off meetings. I'm definitely a camera off guy. I have work to do this isn't Shahs of Sunset

Do you need your morning coffee or do you need to stop staying up until 2:30 doing a wiki deep dive on Stalin's career as a bank robber?
------
Spoiler alert: although the myth was widely promulgated, there's no evidence that Stalin actually robbed a bank or train
------
Lead emoji designer: No, that looks too much like an actual eggplant. We're designing the standin for the human male member here, make it more plump, juicy, and inviting!
------
You will never have all of your needs fulfilled by one person. If that's what you think a "soul mate" is, it is not going to happen. And that's completely ok
------
It's actually pretty touching when you know that large parts of you don't make sense to them, and they clearly care dearly anyhow. It's ok, she doesn't make sense to me either
------
When it comes to the parts she doesn't get, I find friends who share those interests. But do make sure your needs are met one way or another
------
A recession is a psychological phenomenon as much as it is an economic one. It usually doesn't end until the misery it caused has matched the exuberance of the previous upward trend. That's when people feel it's over
------
Granted, there are many real world factors at play in the economy today that have nothing to do with psychology: the droughts, disease. But the choice of when to start expanding again is still highly influenced by feelings
------
Whenever some dickhead blathering on about his home theater setup uses the words "more immersive" I immediately knee him in the balls
------
You know what's immersive? Not watching Fast and Furious movies is the cornerstone of my personal philosophy. It's not about having 9 speakers
------
Yeah if you want something done, ask a busy person. If it’s not really a priority, ask a guy who woke up at one and immediately turned on a playstation
------
Women, do you love She Hulk? Do you just love it? It's FOR YOU. If you don't love it then I don't even know what the point was
------
I watched it next to a woman, and she was on her phone the whole time. She couldn't pay attention for more than a minute at a time. Selling the OC captivates her.
------
What if Charles offers to be king of America too? Like just be king of all of it again? Kinda fun, right? He promises not to be all shitty about it like our last one
------
Real question is, who will be named King's Hand? This could be where bojo makes his move!
------
Corona fever dreams, night three. There is a war inside of me. No quarter is asked and none is given. Either this virus will consume me entire, or I will destroy it for good, for all mankind
------
King Charles like I finally won this game of thrones! 75 years of intricate plotting and scheming paid off!
------
Well I think corona finally got me. Fever 100. I’ll be fine. You are all awesome. 
*starts hallucinating, punches vanity mirror, the doors music plays*

I mean if I’m going to suffer obv I will milk for a few likes
------
You don’t have to eat food you don’t want to eat, ever. If someone insists they are the rude ones. Literally putting something inside of your body or not is a deeply personal choice.
------
Yeah, other people will get their feelings hurt by this. They’ll survive. Do it a few times and they will simply accept it.

I can’t even express how much better I felt in general when I instituted this policy.

If unruly AI was the only possible threat we faced, we might consider not moving forward with it, but we need superhuman machine learning to get us out of all the other jams we’re in, so we have to just floor it and hope it only eats some of us

I feel so bad for the grads who put in the hard work to get a masters in art and land a six figure job at one of the big art firms, only to have expectations crushed by dall-e

Need new bailout, Biden. Social contract has been violated

As children, adults tell us not to lie, and then we see them lie constantly. It took me a lot longer than most to understand what they really meant: only lie when you can get away with it. Lie well or don’t lie at all
------
A grandparent gives a crappy present. You tell the truth, and get in trouble for it. That time a lie was actually required. Most confusing
------
You’re scaring the hoes. I’m forming emotionally intimate relationships with the hoes. We are not the same
------
The elites don’t want you to know this, but you can talk about your true feelings with the bros too
------
I don't think I've ever fallen in love at first sight, but sometimes I see a face and instantly know that I could never love them
------
Well I can't see how this innovative COVID testing glory hole could possibly become its own porn genre.
------
Engineers don't owe you engines
------
I can accept "they" as a singular pronoun, but only if it is accompanied by the singular verb. For example: they is on their fifth white claw.
------
Bluechecks posting their wordle scores are the worst. Hey look everyone, I did pretty well at a total midwit game!
------
Biggest cultural different in tech cos right now is cameras on or cameras off meetings. I'm definitely a camera off guy. I have work to do this isn't Shahs of Sunset

Do you need your morning coffee or do you need to stop staying up until 2:30 doing a wiki deep dive on Stalin's career as a bank robber?
------
Spoiler alert: although the myth was widely promulgated, there's no evidence that Stalin actually robbed a bank or train
------
Lead emoji designer: No, that looks too much like an actual eggplant. We're designing the standin for the human male member here, make it more plump, juicy, and inviting!
------
You will never have all of your needs fulfilled by one person. If that's what you think a "soul mate" is, it is not going to happen. And that's completely ok
------
It's actually pretty touching when you know that large parts of you don't make sense to them, and they clearly care dearly anyhow. It's ok, she doesn't make sense to me either
------
When it comes to the parts she doesn't get, I find friends who share those interests. But do make sure your needs are met one way or another
------
A recession is a psychological phenomenon as much as it is an economic one. It usually doesn't end until the misery it caused has matched the exuberance of the previous upward trend. That's when people feel it's over
------
Granted, there are many real world factors at play in the economy today that have nothing to do with psychology: the droughts, disease. But the choice of when to start expanding again is still highly influenced by feelings
------
Whenever some dickhead blathering on about his home theater setup uses the words "more immersive" I immediately knee him in the balls
------
You know what's immersive? Not watching Fast and Furious movies is the cornerstone of my personal philosophy. It's not about having 9 speakers
------
Yeah if you want something done, ask a busy person. If it’s not really a priority, ask a guy who woke up at one and immediately turned on a playstation
------
Women, do you love She Hulk? Do you just love it? It's FOR YOU. If you don't love it then I don't even know what the point was
------
I watched it next to a woman, and she was on her phone the whole time. She couldn't pay attention for more than a minute at a time. Selling the OC captivates her.
------
What if Charles offers to be king of America too? Like just be king of all of it again? Kinda fun, right? He promises not to be all shitty about it like our last one
------
Real question is, who will be named King's Hand? This could be where bojo makes his move!
------
Corona fever dreams, night three. There is a war inside of me. No quarter is asked and none is given. Either this virus will consume me entire, or I will destroy it for good, for all mankind
------
King Charles like I finally won this game of thrones! 75 years of intricate plotting and scheming paid off!
------
Well I think corona finally got me. Fever 100. I’ll be fine. You are all awesome. 
*starts hallucinating, punches vanity mirror, the doors music plays*

I mean if I’m going to suffer obv I will milk for a few likes
------
You don’t have to eat food you don’t want to eat, ever. If someone insists they are the rude ones. Literally putting something inside of your body or not is a deeply personal choice.
------
Yeah, other people will get their feelings hurt by this. They’ll survive. Do it a few times and they will simply accept it.

I can’t even express how much better I felt in general when I instituted this policy.

If unruly AI was the only possible threat we faced, we might consider not moving forward with it, but we need superhuman machine learning to get us out of all the other jams we’re in, so we have to just floor it and hope it only eats some of us

I feel so bad for the grads who put in the hard work to get a masters in art and land a six figure job at one of the big art firms, only to have expectations crushed by dall-e

Need new bailout, Biden. Social contract has been violated

As children, adults tell us not to lie, and then we see them lie constantly. It took me a lot longer than most to understand what they really meant: only lie when you can get away with it. Lie well or don’t lie at all
------
A grandparent gives a crappy present. You tell the truth, and get in trouble for it. That time a lie was actually required. Most confusing
------
You’re scaring the hoes. I’m forming emotionally intimate relationships with the hoes. We are not the same
------
The elites don’t want you to know this, but you can talk about your true feelings with the bros too
------
I don't think I've ever fallen in love at first sight, but sometimes I see a face and instantly know that I could never love them
------
Well I can't see how this innovative COVID testing glory hole could possibly become its own porn genre.
------
Engineers don't owe you engines
------
I can accept "they" as a singular pronoun, but only if it is accompanied by the singular verb. For example: they is on their fifth white claw.
------
Bluechecks posting their wordle scores are the worst. Hey look everyone, I did pretty well at a total midwit game!
------
Biggest cultural different in tech cos right now is cameras on or cameras off meetings. I'm definitely a camera off guy. I have work to do this isn't Shahs of Sunset

Do you need your morning coffee or do you need to stop staying up until 2:30 doing a wiki deep dive on Stalin's career as a bank robber?
------
Spoiler alert: although the myth was widely promulgated, there's no evidence that Stalin actually robbed a bank or train
------
Lead emoji designer: No, that looks too much like an actual eggplant. We're designing the standin for the human male member here, make it more plump, juicy, and inviting!
------
You will never have all of your needs fulfilled by one person. If that's what you think a "soul mate" is, it is not going to happen. And that's completely ok
------
It's actually pretty touching when you know that large parts of you don't make sense to them, and they clearly care dearly anyhow. It's ok, she doesn't make sense to me either
------
When it comes to the parts she doesn't get, I find friends who share those interests. But do make sure your needs are met one way or another
------
A recession is a psychological phenomenon as much as it is an economic one. It usually doesn't end until the misery it caused has matched the exuberance of the previous upward trend. That's when people feel it's over
------
Granted, there are many real world factors at play in the economy today that have nothing to do with psychology: the droughts, disease. But the choice of when to start expanding again is still highly influenced by feelings
------
Whenever some dickhead blathering on about his home theater setup uses the words "more immersive" I immediately knee him in the balls
------
You know what's immersive? Not watching Fast and Furious movies is the cornerstone of my personal philosophy. It's not about having 9 speakers
------
Yeah if you want something done, ask a busy person. If it’s not really a priority, ask a guy who woke up at one and immediately turned on a playstation
------
Women, do you love She Hulk? Do you just love it? It's FOR YOU. If you don't love it then I don't even know what the point was
------
I watched it next to a woman, and she was on her phone the whole time. She couldn't pay attention for more than a minute at a time. Selling the OC captivates her.
------
What if Charles offers to be king of America too? Like just be king of all of it again? Kinda fun, right? He promises not to be all shitty about it like our last one
------
Real question is, who will be named King's Hand? This could be where bojo makes his move!
------
Corona fever dreams, night three. There is a war inside of me. No quarter is asked and none is given. Either this virus will consume me entire, or I will destroy it for good, for all mankind
------
King Charles like I finally won this game of thrones! 75 years of intricate plotting and scheming paid off!
------
Well I think corona finally got me. Fever 100. I’ll be fine. You are all awesome. 
*starts hallucinating, punches vanity mirror, the doors music plays*

I mean if I’m going to suffer obv I will milk for a few likes
------
You don’t have to eat food you don’t want to eat, ever. If someone insists they are the rude ones. Literally putting something inside of your body or not is a deeply personal choice.
------
Yeah, other people will get their feelings hurt by this. They’ll survive. Do it a few times and they will simply accept it.

I can’t even express how much better I felt in general when I instituted this policy.

If unruly AI was the only possible threat we faced, we might consider not moving forward with it, but we need superhuman machine learning to get us out of all the other jams we’re in, so we have to just floor it and hope it only eats some of us

I feel so bad for the grads who put in the hard work to get a masters in art and land a six figure job at one of the big art firms, only to have expectations crushed by dall-e

Need new bailout, Biden. Social contract has been violated

As children, adults tell us not to lie, and then we see them lie constantly. It took me a lot longer than most to understand what they really meant: only lie when you can get away with it. Lie well or don’t lie at all
------
A grandparent gives a crappy present. You tell the truth, and get in trouble for it. That time a lie was actually required. Most confusing
------
You’re scaring the hoes. I’m forming emotionally intimate relationships with the hoes. We are not the same
------
The elites don’t want you to know this, but you can talk about your true feelings with the bros too
------
I don't think I've ever fallen in love at first sight, but sometimes I see a face and instantly know that I could never love them
------
Well I can't see how this innovative COVID testing glory hole could possibly become its own porn genre.
------
Engineers don't owe you engines
------
I can accept "they" as a singular pronoun, but only if it is accompanied by the singular verb. For example: they is on their fifth white claw.
------
Bluechecks posting their wordle scores are the worst. Hey look everyone, I did pretty well at a total midwit game!
------
Biggest cultural different in tech cos right now is cameras on or cameras off meetings. I'm definitely a camera off guy. I have work to do this isn't Shahs of Sunset

Do you need your morning coffee or do you need to stop staying up until 2:30 doing a wiki deep dive on Stalin's career as a bank robber?
------
Spoiler alert: although the myth was widely promulgated, there's no evidence that Stalin actually robbed a bank or train
------
Lead emoji designer: No, that looks too much like an actual eggplant. We're designing the standin for the human male member here, make it more plump, juicy, and inviting!
------
You will never have all of your needs fulfilled by one person. If that's what you think a "soul mate" is, it is not going to happen. And that's completely ok
------
It's actually pretty touching when you know that large parts of you don't make sense to them, and they clearly care dearly anyhow. It's ok, she doesn't make sense to me either
------
When it comes to the parts she doesn't get, I find friends who share those interests. But do make sure your needs are met one way or another
------
A recession is a psychological phenomenon as much as it is an economic one. It usually doesn't end until the misery it caused has matched the exuberance of the previous upward trend. That's when people feel it's over
------
Granted, there are many real world factors at play in the economy today that have nothing to do with psychology: the droughts, disease. But the choice of when to start expanding again is still highly influenced by feelings
------
Whenever some dickhead blathering on about his home theater setup uses the words "more immersive" I immediately knee him in the balls
------
You know what's immersive? Not watching Fast and Furious movies is the cornerstone of my personal philosophy. It's not about having 9 speakers
------
Yeah if you want something done, ask a busy person. If it’s not really a priority, ask a guy who woke up at one and immediately turned on a playstation
------
Women, do you love She Hulk? Do you just love it? It's FOR YOU. If you don't love it then I don't even know what the point was
------
I watched it next to a woman, and she was on her phone the whole time. She couldn't pay attention for more than a minute at a time. Selling the OC captivates her.
------
What if Charles offers to be king of America too? Like just be king of all of it again? Kinda fun, right? He promises not to be all shitty about it like our last one
------
Real question is, who will be named King's Hand? This could be where bojo makes his move!
------
Corona fever dreams, night three. There is a war inside of me. No quarter is asked and none is given. Either this virus will consume me entire, or I will destroy it for good, for all mankind
------
King Charles like I finally won this game of thrones! 75 years of intricate plotting and scheming paid off!
------
Well I think corona finally got me. Fever 100. I’ll be fine. You are all awesome. 
*starts hallucinating, punches vanity mirror, the doors music plays*

I mean if I’m going to suffer obv I will milk for a few likes
------
You don’t have to eat food you don’t want to eat, ever. If someone insists they are the rude ones. Literally putting something inside of your body or not is a deeply personal choice.
------
Yeah, other people will get their feelings hurt by this. They’ll survive. Do it a few times and they will simply accept it.

I can’t even express how much better I felt in general when I instituted this policy.

If unruly AI was the only possible threat we faced, we might consider not moving forward with it, but we need superhuman machine learning to get us out of all the other jams we’re in, so we have to just floor it and hope it only eats some of us

I feel so bad for the grads who put in the hard work to get a masters in art and land a six figure job at one of the big art firms, only to have expectations crushed by dall-e

Need new bailout, Biden. Social contract has been violated

As children, adults tell us not to lie, and then we see them lie constantly. It took me a lot longer than most to understand what they really meant: only lie when you can get away with it. Lie well or don’t lie at all
------
A grandparent gives a crappy present. You tell the truth, and get in trouble for it. That time a lie was actually required. Most confusing
------
You’re scaring the hoes. I’m forming emotionally intimate relationships with the hoes. We are not the same
------
The elites don’t want you to know this, but you can talk about your true feelings with the bros too
------
I don't think I've ever fallen in love at first sight, but sometimes I see a face and instantly know that I could never love them
------
Well I can't see how this innovative COVID testing glory hole could possibly become its own porn genre.
------
Engineers don't owe you engines
------
I can accept "they" as a singular pronoun, but only if it is accompanied by the singular verb. For example: they is on their fifth white claw.
------
Bluechecks posting their wordle scores are the worst. Hey look everyone, I did pretty well at a total midwit game!
------
Biggest cultural different in tech cos right now is cameras on or cameras off meetings. I'm definitely a camera off guy. I have work to do this isn't Shahs of Sunset

Do you need your morning coffee or do you need to stop staying up until 2:30 doing a wiki deep dive on Stalin's career as a bank robber?
------
Spoiler alert: although the myth was widely promulgated, there's no evidence that Stalin actually robbed a bank or train
------
Lead emoji designer: No, that looks too much like an actual eggplant. We're designing the standin for the human male member here, make it more plump, juicy, and inviting!
------
You will never have all of your needs fulfilled by one person. If that's what you think a "soul mate" is, it is not going to happen. And that's completely ok
------
It's actually pretty touching when you know that large parts of you don't make sense to them, and they clearly care dearly anyhow. It's ok, she doesn't make sense to me either
------
When it comes to the parts she doesn't get, I find friends who share those interests. But do make sure your needs are met one way or another
------
A recession is a psychological phenomenon as much as it is an economic one. It usually doesn't end until the misery it caused has matched the exuberance of the previous upward trend. That's when people feel it's over
------
Granted, there are many real world factors at play in the economy today that have nothing to do with psychology: the droughts, disease. But the choice of when to start expanding again is still highly influenced by feelings
------
Whenever some dickhead blathering on about his home theater setup uses the words "more immersive" I immediately knee him in the balls
------
You know what's immersive? Not watching Fast and Furious movies is the cornerstone of my personal philosophy. It's not about having 9 speakers
------
Yeah if you want something done, ask a busy person. If it’s not really a priority, ask a guy who woke up at one and immediately turned on a playstation
------
Women, do you love She Hulk? Do you just love it? It's FOR YOU. If you don't love it then I don't even know what the point was
------
I watched it next to a woman, and she was on her phone the whole time. She couldn't pay attention for more than a minute at a time. Selling the OC captivates her.
------
What if Charles offers to be king of America too? Like just be king of all of it again? Kinda fun, right? He promises not to be all shitty about it like our last one
------
Real question is, who will be named King's Hand? This could be where bojo makes his move!
------
Corona fever dreams, night three. There is a war inside of me. No quarter is asked and none is given. Either this virus will consume me entire, or I will destroy it for good, for all mankind
------
King Charles like I finally won this game of thrones! 75 years of intricate plotting and scheming paid off!
------
Well I think corona finally got me. Fever 100. I’ll be fine. You are all awesome. 
*starts hallucinating, punches vanity mirror, the doors music plays*

I mean if I’m going to suffer obv I will milk for a few likes
------
You don’t have to eat food you don’t want to eat, ever. If someone insists they are the rude ones. Literally putting something inside of your body or not is a deeply personal choice.
------
Yeah, other people will get their feelings hurt by this. They’ll survive. Do it a few times and they will simply accept it.

I can’t even express how much better I felt in general when I instituted this policy.

If unruly AI was the only possible threat we faced, we might consider not moving forward with it, but we need superhuman machine learning to get us out of all the other jams we’re in, so we have to just floor it and hope it only eats some of us

I feel so bad for the grads who put in the hard work to get a masters in art and land a six figure job at one of the big art firms, only to have expectations crushed by dall-e

Need new bailout, Biden. Social contract has been violated

As children, adults tell us not to lie, and then we see them lie constantly. It took me a lot longer than most to understand what they really meant: only lie when you can get away with it. Lie well or don’t lie at all
------
A grandparent gives a crappy present. You tell the truth, and get in trouble for it. That time a lie was actually required. Most confusing
------
You’re scaring the hoes. I’m forming emotionally intimate relationships with the hoes. We are not the same
------
The elites don’t want you to know this, but you can talk about your true feelings with the bros too
------
I don't think I've ever fallen in love at first sight, but sometimes I see a face and instantly know that I could never love them
------
Well I can't see how this innovative COVID testing glory hole could possibly become its own porn genre.
------
Engineers don't owe you engines
------
I can accept "they" as a singular pronoun, but only if it is accompanied by the singular verb. For example: they is on their fifth white claw.
------
Bluechecks posting their wordle scores are the worst. Hey look everyone, I did pretty well at a total midwit game!
------
Biggest cultural different in tech cos right now is cameras on or cameras off meetings. I'm definitely a camera off guy. I have work to do this isn't Shahs of Sunset

Do you need your morning coffee or do you need to stop staying up until 2:30 doing a wiki deep dive on Stalin's career as a bank robber?
------
Spoiler alert: although the myth was widely promulgated, there's no evidence that Stalin actually robbed a bank or train
------
Lead emoji designer: No, that looks too much like an actual eggplant. We're designing the standin for the human male member here, make it more plump, juicy, and inviting!
------
You will never have all of your needs fulfilled by one person. If that's what you think a "soul mate" is, it is not going to happen. And that's completely ok
------
It's actually pretty touching when you know that large parts of you don't make sense to them, and they clearly care dearly anyhow. It's ok, she doesn't make sense to me either
------
When it comes to the parts she doesn't get, I find friends who share those interests. But do make sure your needs are met one way or another
------
A recession is a psychological phenomenon as much as it is an economic one. It usually doesn't end until the misery it caused has matched the exuberance of the previous upward trend. That's when people feel it's over
------
Granted, there are many real world factors at play in the economy today that have nothing to do with psychology: the droughts, disease. But the choice of when to start expanding again is still highly influenced by feelings
------
Whenever some dickhead blathering on about his home theater setup uses the words "more immersive" I immediately knee him in the balls
------
You know what's immersive? Not watching Fast and Furious movies is the cornerstone of my personal philosophy. It's not about having 9 speakers
------
Yeah if you want something done, ask a busy person. If it’s not really a priority, ask a guy who woke up at one and immediately turned on a playstation
------
Women, do you love She Hulk? Do you just love it? It's FOR YOU. If you don't love it then I don't even know what the point was
------
I watched it next to a woman, and she was on her phone the whole time. She couldn't pay attention for more than a minute at a time. Selling the OC captivates her.
------
What if Charles offers to be king of America too? Like just be king of all of it again? Kinda fun, right? He promises not to be all shitty about it like our last one
------
Real question is, who will be named King's Hand? This could be where bojo makes his move!
------
Corona fever dreams, night three. There is a war inside of me. No quarter is asked and none is given. Either this virus will consume me entire, or I will destroy it for good, for all mankind
------
King Charles like I finally won this game of thrones! 75 years of intricate plotting and scheming paid off!
------
Well I think corona finally got me. Fever 100. I’ll be fine. You are all awesome. 
*starts hallucinating, punches vanity mirror, the doors music plays*

I mean if I’m going to suffer obv I will milk for a few likes
------
You don’t have to eat food you don’t want to eat, ever. If someone insists they are the rude ones. Literally putting something inside of your body or not is a deeply personal choice.
------
Yeah, other people will get their feelings hurt by this. They’ll survive. Do it a few times and they will simply accept it.

I can’t even express how much better I felt in general when I instituted this policy.

If unruly AI was the only possible threat we faced, we might consider not moving forward with it, but we need superhuman machine learning to get us out of all the other jams we’re in, so we have to just floor it and hope it only eats some of us

I feel so bad for the grads who put in the hard work to get a masters in art and land a six figure job at one of the big art firms, only to have expectations crushed by dall-e

Need new bailout, Biden. Social contract has been violated

As children, adults tell us not to lie, and then we see them lie constantly. It took me a lot longer than most to understand what they really meant: only lie when you can get away with it. Lie well or don’t lie at all
------
A grandparent gives a crappy present. You tell the truth, and get in trouble for it. That time a lie was actually required. Most confusing
------
You’re scaring the hoes. I’m forming emotionally intimate relationships with the hoes. We are not the same
------
The elites don’t want you to know this, but you can talk about your true feelings with the bros too
------
I don't think I've ever fallen in love at first sight, but sometimes I see a face and instantly know that I could never love them
------
Well I can't see how this innovative COVID testing glory hole could possibly become its own porn genre.
------
Engineers don't owe you engines
------
I can accept "they" as a singular pronoun, but only if it is accompanied by the singular verb. For example: they is on their fifth white claw.
------
Bluechecks posting their wordle scores are the worst. Hey look everyone, I did pretty well at a total midwit game!
------
Biggest cultural different in tech cos right now is cameras on or cameras off meetings. I'm definitely a camera off guy. I have work to do this isn't Shahs of Sunset

Do you need your morning coffee or do you need to stop staying up until 2:30 doing a wiki deep dive on Stalin's career as a bank robber?
------
Spoiler alert: although the myth was widely promulgated, there's no evidence that Stalin actually robbed a bank or train
------
Lead emoji designer: No, that looks too much like an actual eggplant. We're designing the standin for the human male member here, make it more plump, juicy, and inviting!
------
You will never have all of your needs fulfilled by one person. If that's what you think a "soul mate" is, it is not going to happen. And that's completely ok
------
It's actually pretty touching when you know that large parts of you don't make sense to them, and they clearly care dearly anyhow. It's ok, she doesn't make sense to me either
------
When it comes to the parts she doesn't get, I find friends who share those interests. But do make sure your needs are met one way or another
------
A recession is a psychological phenomenon as much as it is an economic one. It usually doesn't end until the misery it caused has matched the exuberance of the previous upward trend. That's when people feel it's over
------
Granted, there are many real world factors at play in the economy today that have nothing to do with psychology: the droughts, disease. But the choice of when to start expanding again is still highly influenced by feelings
------
Whenever some dickhead blathering on about his home theater setup uses the words "more immersive" I immediately knee him in the balls
------
You know what's immersive? Not watching Fast and Furious movies is the cornerstone of my personal philosophy. It's not about having 9 speakers
------
Yeah if you want something done, ask a busy person. If it’s not really a priority, ask a guy who woke up at one and immediately turned on a playstation
------
Women, do you love She Hulk? Do you just love it? It's FOR YOU. If you don't love it then I don't even know what the point was
------
I watched it next to a woman, and she was on her phone the whole time. She couldn't pay attention for more than a minute at a time. Selling the OC captivates her.
------
What if Charles offers to be king of America too? Like just be king of all of it again? Kinda fun, right? He promises not to be all shitty about it like our last one
------
Real question is, who will be named King's Hand? This could be where bojo makes his move!
------
Corona fever dreams, night three. There is a war inside of me. No quarter is asked and none is given. Either this virus will consume me entire, or I will destroy it for good, for all mankind
------
King Charles like I finally won this game of thrones! 75 years of intricate plotting and scheming paid off!
------
Well I think corona finally got me. Fever 100. I’ll be fine. You are all awesome. 
*starts hallucinating, punches vanity mirror, the doors music plays*

I mean if I’m going to suffer obv I will milk for a few likes
------
You don’t have to eat food you don’t want to eat, ever. If someone insists they are the rude ones. Literally putting something inside of your body or not is a deeply personal choice.
------
Yeah, other people will get their feelings hurt by this. They’ll survive. Do it a few times and they will simply accept it.

I can’t even express how much better I felt in general when I instituted this policy.

If unruly AI was the only possible threat we faced, we might consider not moving forward with it, but we need superhuman machine learning to get us out of all the other jams we’re in, so we have to just floor it and hope it only eats some of us

I feel so bad for the grads who put in the hard work to get a masters in art and land a six figure job at one of the big art firms, only to have expectations crushed by dall-e

Need new bailout, Biden. Social contract has been violated
