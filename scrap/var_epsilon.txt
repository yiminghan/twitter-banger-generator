my roadmap to learning computers
- electrons
- electronic circuits
- transistors
- logic gates
- latches
- digital circuits
- comp arch (CPU, memory)
- machine language
- assembly
- C/C++
- DS, algos
- OOP
- OS
- python
- web dev
- data science (numpy, pandas)
- ML (torch, CUDA)
------
at this point why include a manual at all
------
sending out a PR and immediately taking a coffee break is a peak SWE experience
------
having a giant doc with every contribution I make is goated when generating resume bullets via LLM is the vibe
------
shkreli is speedrunning this twitter thing
------
Do i need a basement to build AGI? Can i do it on the ground floor, or perhaps even upstairs?
------
soon every single ai researcher will have their own company and it will be one huge battle royale
------
say what you want about ML but it’s certainly not moving slowly
------
you can learn a lot about a person by their retainer
------
this geohot-yud debate is going literally nowhere
------
I’m just an intern trapped in the body of a full timer
------
releasing all this alpha for free is insanely based
------
The trilogy is complete! My "Advanced Topics" book is officially released today. Buy it on Amazon, or get it for free at https://probml.github.io/pml-book/book2.html….
------
the optimal workday is one that involves me eating lunch completely alone

why are you, as a man, using anything besides a folding table as your desk
------
taking risks is paramount to the human experience
------
this is all you really need as a man
------
do you browse the web in a dfs fashion or are you more of the bfs type
------
every leetcode problem is just some combination of ~10 fundamental problems. the eigenproblems if you will
------
in high school did you have competitions to see who could fill out the unit circle fastest or are you normal

adapt or die

the stem vs humanities divide is fake. the real divide is between those who learn because they love knowledge and those who do it begrudgingly

It always surprises me how gleeful non-STEM grads are to subject engineering students to a course load that's 25% humanities.

The reverse is never true -- I don't think liberal arts colleges should subject students to Thermodynamics & E&M! twitter.com/ConradBastable…

it's difficult to overstate how up to date the terminally online are compared to the rest of the world. i constantly talk to people who are firmly grounded in the real world and find out they're missing entire gaps of recent world history

Wow. Pi is annoying to work with, and then doesnt do the job. Courtesy of @Dogesator

the way it works is pretty simple, I have a cronjob that reads a table of RSS feeds, grabs a small summary from gpt based on the post description, and sends everything to supabase

yes you could use an RSS reader for all of this but figured rolling my own would be fun

yes I'm self doxxing, figured it's a necessary evil if I want to share code. will be posting other projects in the coming days and happy to take PRs!

this is actually how I learnt to do math better. In high school i sat next to the smartest person i'd ever met (math olympiad) and just watched him solve problems. Same thing for gaming too, just backseat them and watch them move their mouse around. It actually helps

the youth need me to write a vscode setup tutorial
------
probably missing a few
------
this is a really cool feeling, I shied away from publicizing my work for a long time bc I didn't think people would find it very interesting

very cool to see the power of open source at play, excited to hopefully accelerate my own dev speed by taking help from others
------
threads vs. twitter discourse with non tpotters is no fun at all
------
spent the last couple days building out http://engblogs.dev, a site that aggregates engineering blogposts from 20 companies that I like
------
the way it works is pretty simple, I have a cronjob that reads a table of RSS feeds, grabs a small summary from gpt based on the post description, and sends everything to supabase

yes you could use an RSS reader for all of this but figured rolling my own would be fun
------
github is here: https://github.com/ishan0102/engblogs…

yes I'm self doxxing, figured it's a necessary evil if I want to share code. will be posting other projects in the coming days and happy to take PRs!
------
this is actually how I learnt to do math better. In high school i sat next to the smartest person i'd ever met (math olympiad) and just watched him solve problems. Same thing for gaming too, just backseat them and watch them move their mouse around. It actually helps

Hi

never ask a woman her age, a man his salary, or a GPT wrapper startup their openai bill

db done, generated summaries from rss descriptions, now just building a frontend hopefully done by tomo
------
now that I’ve gotten into the habit of tweeting I find it very hard to not at least draft something whenever I have an idea

makes me wonder how many thoughts were lost to the void in the years before I made this account
------
hard to get into the mentality of not doing too much when building side projects

it's tempting for me to install black and isort, set up proper error handling, use good db conventions etc. but I think that stuff should wait until my idea is functioning and validated
------
I’m staying here til the bitter end I don’t fw threads
------
I used to overengineer many of my side projects. Mainly because that’s how I thought it should work and scale. None of that matters when the thing has zero users, even if it had 100 or 1,000 it would still not need that complexity. Now I just aim to ship
------
lol. lmao, even
------
would be fun to have a yc-cloneathon where we try to recreate as many gpt wrapper startups from the last couple batches as possible within 24 hours
------
user feedback can be humbling but is very, very important. glad I only spent ~10 days of dev time building all this stuff out rather than a couple months building a more comprehensive product just to potentially receive feedback I should’ve heard early on
------
user feedback is ground truth and hard to accurately model by any one person. going back to iterating and building for a bit

my current workflow for saving cool arxiv papers to notion in a few clicks
------
you can view the notion table here: https://notion.so/varepsilon/53dbe39a07834d0dbef03fb9a9b77abf?v=8b48f90c2d934271ab39c5792972fd8c…

this is a really hacky plan, hoping to build a more cohesive interface soon but all the different parts are at least working now
------
I'll try to publish the extension to the chrome store soon but you can load it as an unpacked extension for now, lots of annoying stuff to do to make it an official extension
------
really cool documentary, rare bts look on how rap albums are produced start to finish

many parallels btwn shipping music and shipping products

I think one of the biggest mistakes people make is doing a master’s degree solely to wait for the tech market to get better

if you are that confident that you can predict the market you should go into finance not tech
------
many people I know tacked on an extra year to their degree to do an extra major or integrated master’s and I think they may find that the 2024 new grad market is worse than it was in 2023

doing a master’s is fine I just think you need a better reason than stalling

one of the fastest ways to grow is to realize that very few people genuinely care about whether or not you achieve your goals. this feels incredibly freeing and also ensures that you keep working because help is rarely coming

It’s a big week! We’ve raised $1.3 billion and are building the world’s largest AI cluster (22k H100s).

We’re grateful for our investors and new funding that will help us accelerate our mission to make personal AI available to every person in the world. https://inflection.ai/inflection-ai-announces-1-3-billion-of-funding…

people who actively use these models can literally feel the vibe shifts, crazy

simply by using models way more than others you build an edge since you know how to tweak prompts / converse with models to get exactly the output you want

I was on airplane mode listening to a downloaded playlist, tried to turn shuffle off, and it hung for 5 sec and errored out. who asked for this
------
spotify try not to make your software utterly unusable for longtime paying users challenge (difficulty: IMPOSSIBLE)
------
for context, smart shuffle is supposed to occasionally throw songs it thinks you’d like into the shuffle queue. but for some reason it queries for those songs every time you try cycling from on to smart shuffle. so there’s no way to quickly toggle between shuffle on / off now
------
so when you’re online, the UX becomes really slow, and when you’re offline, it somehow still tries to query for songs you’d like but can’t, so you always get an error. pls add feature flag to settings or something

my roadmap to learning computers
- electrons
- electronic circuits
- transistors
- logic gates
- latches
- digital circuits
- comp arch (CPU, memory)
- machine language
- assembly
- C/C++
- DS, algos
- OOP
- OS
- python
- web dev
- data science (numpy, pandas)
- ML (torch, CUDA)

spotify smart shuffle is so dogshit it’s kind of hilarious. shuffle is no longer a toggle, it cycles through off / on / smart shuffle

I was on airplane mode listening to a downloaded playlist, tried to turn shuffle off, and it hung for 5 sec and errored out. who asked for this
------
spotify try not to make your software utterly unusable for longtime paying users challenge (difficulty: IMPOSSIBLE)
------
for context, smart shuffle is supposed to occasionally throw songs it thinks you’d like into the shuffle queue. but for some reason it queries for those songs every time you try cycling from on to smart shuffle. so there’s no way to quickly toggle between shuffle on / off now
------
so when you’re online, the UX becomes really slow, and when you’re offline, it somehow still tries to query for songs you’d like but can’t, so you always get an error. pls add feature flag to settings or something

The more ambitious you are, the more the world will try to bring you down.

As far as I know, only intrinsic motivators can push you through the social currents until you reach escape velocity: your work is so good that it defends itself/you against criticism.

so many people saying stuff like “you don’t need to know electrons to do ML” on my poast and I’m here like ML was never the end game I’m trying to do something a lot bigger if you don’t realize the value of understanding the universe from first principles that’s on you

I love end-user programming. It’s when products are built to allow end-users to either use them as-is, or hack them to meet their needs.

I initially learned about this from 
@inkandswitch
, who built a programmable canvas (1/3).
------
Finally, I love what 
@browsercompany
 is doing with Arc, allowing anyone to customize any website. I’d love to see this kind of hackability in more products and am interested in seeing AI incorporated into apps with this notion in mind. (3/3)

I love end-user programming. It’s when products are built to allow end-users to either use them as-is, or hack them to meet their needs.

I initially learned about this from 
@inkandswitch
, who built a programmable canvas (1/3).
------
Finally, I love what 
@browsercompany
 is doing with Arc, allowing anyone to customize any website. I’d love to see this kind of hackability in more products and am interested in seeing AI incorporated into apps with this notion in mind. (3/3)

Why @lexfridman is a grifter manlet

I'm kinda bearish on db startups like supabase recently after seeing tweets like this and articles like https://blog.val.town/blog/migrating-from-supabase…

if pg is good enough for figma it's good enough for me

same for pgvector / vector db startups etc

Figma is like a startup from an alien civilization

"What language is the web app written in?" 
"C++"

"What kind of graphics primitives does it use?"
"Oh, we invented new ones."

"How does the massive database work?"
"It's just in postgres." 

It's so weird lol twitter.com/lawrjones/stat…

If you are an AI startup and need compute: DM me

Numerous chromebooks on standby. Macbooks airs if you need.

Now Macbook pros - that’s a different story but hey - if you need it, you’ll get it. 

roughly two years for ~50m / llama and you’re done.

If you are an AI startup & need compute: DM me

Numerous H100s on standby. A10s if you need. 

Now A100 - that's a different story but hey - if you need it, you'll get it.

Roughly two weeks for ~50b / Llama and you're done.  twitter.com/natfriedman/st…

Nice slide. This is also why the terminology can be a bit confusing in AI, because it’s evolved so much and wandered through lots of fields. But now the terminology is what it is.

watching tv while writing code has made me extremely good at bifurcating my mind - I can usually recall entire episodes without really paying attention
------
how is the apple keyboard next word predictor still so bad in 2023
------
if I use selenium to spoof a browser to grab an auth cookie can I get in trouble
------
at least pick a harder problem to stake your claim on
------
A problem from my 12yo’s math. 

We are firmly past what 99% of adults ever need to know and clearly into abstract reasoning development. 

Most people should stop math education in middle school.  They know enough and further math instruction is a waste of time and frustrating.
------
This is an interesting example, now that I take a second look. The kind of person who thinks the math even in this one picture can be replaced with some code implementation on GitHub and that the math part is superfluous is just never, ever going to understand what is going on.
------
I need a reading research paper math tutor. Will trade network, $, knowledge for better math skills.
------
got off the waitlist for copilot chat beta we're so back
------

------
was thinking about this yesterday and jotted a couple notes down
------
maybe the worst UX of 2023

why are you making me delete this app, download a new one and login again when you could have just rebranded the original one ???

@ipsumkyle
 did you pull up
------
holy fak it’s already been 6mo
------
ChatGPT has been 10xing Software Engineers for over 6 months now, so we should be seeing now a flurry of projects which otherwise would take 5 years to build. So where are they?
------
discord is a personal, greppable knowledge hub if you use it right
------
“discord as a backend”
------
anyone remember how slime molds can somehow map out interstate roads better than urban planners? still find that so fascinating
------
tpot miraculously meets at the schelling point of every platform
------
the secrets of the universe are just sitting on the arxiv servers at cornell
------
still not really sure how to come to terms with the fact that my CPU cooler has a chip with "real time face tracking" and "deep learning acceleration" on it. to display jpegs.
------
“tracking compute…”
------
something like an IAEA for advanced AI is worth considering, and the shape of the tech may make it feasible:

(and to make this harder to willfully misinterpret: it's important that any such regulation not constrain AI below a high capability threshold)

had a great first week of the openai world tour in toronto, DC, rio, lagos, and lisbon.

fun to see what people are building and get (lots of) feature requests, and even fun to talk to policymakers!

for long plane rides they should just administer anesthesia through the oxygen masks that lasts for the duration of the flight

no screaming babies, no annoying passengers, no food service

Unspoken fact:

Many OpenAI employees deeply disagree with the fear-mongering propaganda narrative that cutting edge open models pose an existential threat to humanity. This is partially evidenced by the 400+ people who’ve _formerly_ worked there (LinkedIn data).

chatgpt app with whisper is so useful for interview practice

WTF: Mind reading is here.

Researchers invented a new #AI method to convert brain signals into video. See the results for yourself 

Published in Nature yesterday: https://nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06031-6…

What are the implications? Is this the biggest paper of 2023?

Hey @vercel @rauchg @leeerob 

I think what you're doing over there is really cool

I've been using NextJS as my go-to framework for the past 3 years, w/ internships @beondeck and @CertiK

I'd love to join you on your journey to empowering developers to ship fast and reliably

"what is BERT" as a fox news article is so crazy man
------
I’m mid at frontend but by asking gpt4 with browsing to look at a few websites and help me design a site, it:
1. digested the code and understood common themes
2. gave me all the nextjs code and app structure
3. walked me through a full deploy
------
I know how to do all of this stuff but having something tell you all the steps massively reduces cognitive load

iterating is such a breeze, the second order effects of ~0 effort to prototype seem huge in theory but I don’t get why more people aren’t doing this

Hey @vercel @rauchg @leeerob 

I think what you're doing over there is really cool

I've been using NextJS as my go-to framework for the past 3 years, w/ internships @beondeck and @CertiK

I'd love to join you on your journey to empowering developers to ship fast and reliably
------
"what is BERT" as a fox news article is so crazy man
------
I’m mid at frontend but by asking gpt4 with browsing to look at a few websites and help me design a site, it:
1. digested the code and understood common themes
2. gave me all the nextjs code and app structure
3. walked me through a full deploy
------
I know how to do all of this stuff but having something tell you all the steps massively reduces cognitive load

iterating is such a breeze, the second order effects of ~0 effort to prototype seem huge in theory but I don’t get why more people aren’t doing this
------
this bodes well for SWEs who are super familiar with these tools - we’ll see a divergence of engineering talent where 10x->100x and 0.5x->0.1x
------
I think ChatGPT/GPT-4 hype has hit a plateau.
Real-world impact still unclear.

Midjourney, Runway Gen-2, and Robots have got most of my attention currently.
------
they called me crazy when I went all in on meta at $98

we’re so back

- forgot to bring extra connectors
- lost heat gun 
- shipping boxes are late
- code doesn’t work 

yet we ball regardless

peacock recsys is next level
------
also why do they hide the continue watching menu so low on the page
------
when AI art was slightly worse than human level people were angry and argued that humans were better. now with better models, the discourse has shifted in spaces like youtube comments and instagram posts to excitement about new horizons
------
(since X is always just below their capability)
------
idea I want to try
- represent a codebase as a weighted graph with edges being the number of references to other functions
- storing the different parts of the codebase as natural language summaries from gpt4
- given some query like “add a button that hits a new route”

(cont.)
------
and allowing for this kind of recursive exploration may mean this could work for bigger codebases. perhaps this could work as a new paradigm like karpathy suggested where certain sections of code are wrapped into LLM calls
------
overall I’m just really curious about ways to augment coding interaction with LLMs. I find myself copy pasting in and out of chatgpt too much to where I think we’re not even close to the frontier of ai assisted programming

what’s the point of being rich if you wake up alone

last night I built a discord bot that lets me send arxiv papers, extracts the metadata, and sticks it into a notion db. it's running on a free ec2 instance. the kicker is that I've been meaning to do this but was lazy, decided to plug into gpt4 and the whole thing took 1 hour

it's crazy because this is my first time building a discord bot but I feel like an expert already. I could build so many other things so fast. aside from iteration speeds, it feels like gpt is letting me learn much much faster than I could before

#GPT4 saved my dog's life.

I am tempted to build a gpt-exocortex via discord

last night I built a discord bot that lets me send arxiv papers, extracts the metadata, and sticks it into a notion db. it's running on a free ec2 instance. the kicker is that I've been meaning to do this but was lazy, decided to plug into gpt4 and the whole thing took 1 hour 
------
it's crazy because this is my first time building a discord bot but I feel like an expert already. I could build so many other things so fast. aside from iteration speeds, it feels like gpt is letting me learn much much faster than I could before

i wonder how copilot feels when i paste in code from gpt4. do you think it realizes the code is written by its brethren and not a mere mortal like myself

also a fan of discord webhooks - you can make a channel for github and hook repos up to it. so I get discord notifs for new commits, stars, issues, etc

I like stream of consciousness interfaces because you always see the most recent / relevant content first. with tools like notion and workflowy I end up thinking too much about organization and eventually stop using them. but I’ve been actively using this discord strat for months

Some personal news: I am joining OpenAI (again :)). Like many others both in/out of AI, I am very inspired by the impact of their work and I have personally benefited greatly from it. The future potential is especially exciting; it is a great pleasure to jump back in and build!

I’ve found that API design for popular libraries is really thoughtful. a good exercise is to think deeply about why certain words were chosen for method names. e.g. np.broadcast can feel daunting to beginners — but if you think about the semantics it’s not so bad!

note that this is limited to beginners mostly, you’re not gonna reason your way into understanding np.einsum
------
totally agree! preserving optionality is the root of suffering
