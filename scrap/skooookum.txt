thinking one of your coworkers is hot may seem fun at first, but unfortunately it is illegal

i’m not excessively concerned with analyzing myself beyond what serves an obvious utility

my biggest pet peeve with oppenheimer is that during the post-bomb celebrations they have Richard Feynman playing bongos, whereas he didn’t learn how to play bongos until many years after the war on a trip to Brazil

this is more annoying to me than the 50 stars on the flag. the flag is a dumb error. someone had to do a bit of research for the Feynman bongos bit but either didn’t do enough to realize he learned later or put it in knowing anyways :/

the likes aren’t hitting like they used to, right anon?

now you’re jonesin’ for something a little headier, a little more visceral

you’re done with the earnestpoasting

you’re done with the woo woo bullshit

it’s time to start some discourse, isn’t it anon?

i have just learned that the accusation at the heart of the drama on woo-tpot appears to be “sending negative energy without consent” and the situation has gone from concerning to hilarious

abdul loves honking at pretty women. two quick beeps. he popped a curb and went “ope! yay!”
------
i’m in a lyft with abdul and he’s facetiming someone, presumably in the middle east, while he fights rush hour midtown manhattan traffic

they are arguing and the camera keeps panning to a couple of bleating goats. i can only assume they are discussing dowry for a beautiful woman
------
only 7 blocks left in an all-time top 5 lyft ride
------
every time the maps app dictates some orders to him he gets testy and mutters something middle eastern sounding under his breath

Truthfully you should fear any man that follows any sort of dogma, whether it’s veganism, tradcath, Marxism, new age spirituality, etc. Doesn’t matter, it’s all just window dressing for their narcissism. A good man is a bit of a himbo, he just wants to grill and build things
