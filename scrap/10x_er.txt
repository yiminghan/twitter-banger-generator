george will always win against the word maxxers because he has both angles (deep knowledge and calm delivery). listening to Yud and others from the same camp you can tell they are desperate to sound correct, which gives all their arguments a bad smell

being a good poaster is so much easier than being a good reply guy

never trust people that have an answer for everything, they are usually just good at answering questions not giving correct answers

anybody want to start a diamond nanobot company with me just had a really good original idea

my live unfiltered reactions to hotz v. yud livestream thread:

everything is being discussed from metaphor George needs to bring things back into reality I don't think Yud has any idea how to apply this doomer logic irl

ok I gotta get back to work sorry for the spam this convo is kinda cringe and sounds like all the podcasts he's ever done

my favorite discussion dynamic with junior engineers is that “we” made a mistake and conversely that “you” did this correct

My friend is an elementary school teacher in the Bay Area sent me this picture - what they confiscated this month
------
the only way we can stop this is by decentralizing compute
------
why is it that a kindle / ipad (technically a better reading experience) is never as fun as reading a physical paper book?
------
if you guys didn’t know also you can send your kindle *epub files over email and it just appears there actually goated
------
e/acc logo tattooing in the bathroom is currently being investigated
------
how come it’s always “gm” but never “gn”, gn everyone
------
yes I get paid for coming up with intellectual discourse and serving it to the public it’s actually really cool and I love Elon more than I did last year when he was making 420 jokes
------
the best time to be smart was 10 years ago the second best time was also 10 years ago now is a bad time
------
also I should get the kindle version for free if I bought the physical book

experts don’t want you to know this 1 simple trick to increase productivity by 10x

 69/420

everyone hates meetings but sometimes you just start figuring shit out with the team and it runs 2 hours long but its so worth it, rare but amazing vibe
------
wake up, skip breakfast, blasted by cortisol from remembering last week’s deliverable, headphones on volume dangerous, this is the life I dreamt of

what did you get done this weekend?

all a man wants is to put his body and mind through physical and intellectual hell and maybe receive a compliment once a decade
------
Some of y'all be wil'ing out in my DMs  
------
how do we know Dunning or Kruger weren’t at the first Y peak when they made the graph huh
------
so many intelligent people stuck in big tech doing absolute bs and there’s no way to convince them they are destined for more
------
same with with academia pilled ppl
------
instead have you guys tried making room temperature something of yourselves?
------
ain’t that the truth brother
------
coming from someone who is horrible at leetcode, shako and yacine are right you just have to do it and it makes you a better engineer there’s 0 overthinking to do here
------
I should read new SOTA on arxiv, it’s time to re-implement to remember this thing again, should I buy a personal rack mount? maybe I should be leetcoding more, should write more on s*bs*t*ck, need to ship.. need to
------
if you're in a technical space you're working in a high stimulus environment. so much state to hold in your head, many design and engineering decisions to make. its best to lower the level of stimulus for things outside of your work (e.g. reading > short form content)
------
me vs anybody who says “you’re an adult, why are you watching anime, it’s just cartoons”
------
really sad that I saw that one post earlier about taking a break from music for focus, I love music, but I know they are so right, my listening time is easily 10hrs/day

if you have to uninstall an app so it’s not taking over your life then you haven’t solved the problem and something else will fill the void. you need to find something that’s of equal interest but a sign flip in productivity for this change to stick

Announcing the first ever KRAZAM LIVE SHOW 

HOW TO SURVIVE THE A.I. APOCALYPSE 

LIVE COMEDY || INTERACTIVE SEGMENTS || EXCLUSIVE NEW VIDS || FORBIDDEN KNOWLEDGE

I knew hardware wasn’t for me when I bricked my PS3 trying to jailbreak it for MW2
------
I hate that there are so many options to buy things now, I have to watch 300 YouTube videos before making any purchases. It should just be expensive+good and cheaper+ok. I'm losing my mind.
------
my solution has been to just buy the most expensive option so I don’t have fomo
------
I think instead of pinning our bangers we should pin our worst tweets
------
move fast, deliver, and have other people fix your code later
------
tweets should auto delete within 24 hours
------
way too much energy rn wtf should I do with all this energy and intelligence
------
nothing quite like gaslighting your engineering competency by getting back into some fun leetcode problems!
------
it’s so over
------
bro the ultimate “it’s so over / we are so back” is the shitty to dope work item pipeline. like sometimes you wake up and don’t wanna do shit and other days you don’t go to bed, need to optimize for latter
------
how’s everyone’s work day going? get off twitter
------
bro the ultimate “it’s so over / we are so back” is the shitty to dope work item pipeline. like sometimes you wake up and don’t wanna do shit and other days you don’t go to bed, need to optimize for latter
------
the reason I don't have e/acc in my name is because I got it in my blood
------
wait maybe the move is to be a manager but then just work on personal projects? 
------
the best part about being a bit more senior on a team is going to bat for the homies trying to do dope shit
------
my loss function is so simple it consists of:

be in extremely good shape

be the best engineer

if I just minimize h(x) = f’(fitness) + g’(skill) I swear I’ll be happy
------
engineers love tools too much and managers love products too much
------
one of the first times I realized Twitter was powerful and full of interesting people
------
I’m like Batman but instead of Alfred I have you
------
the academic elites don’t want you to know this but it’s actually pretty easy to make a “room temperature” superconductor
------
anyone else having a feeling that something bad is going to happen or is that just me
------
the biggest time saving scam is ordering food
------
just cook bro you’re an adult also go lift something heavy wtf
------
waking up trying to decided which memetic faction to align myself to is real stressful business and takes priority over work
------
guys I fixed the twitter building we are all good
------
yeah so you might be thinking why is there an apostrophe and an underscore and the answer is
------
you guys are so silly the way to tweet bangers is just to be closer to the twitter building that way the servers prioritize your tweets
------
all my heroes sold out or became activists instead of building cool stuff
------
dam it’s really over
------
X time baby
------
you guys ever think about the fact that girls just wanna have fun?
------
whoever is in charge of this algorithm deserves a raise
------
so instead of a checkmark can we get an “x” next to our names?
------
why doesn’t sf look like Singapore
------
Bro did you seriously just e/acc all over the carpet??
------
new flirting technique dropped
------
if her post gets more likes I’m claiming sexism I swear
------

it’s time for me to read Nietzsche

its crazy how you can just stop talking to someone and   then next thing you know they are a stranger again because it turns out you were the only one putting in effort
------
what’s crazier is that’s probably me in someone’s life without even knowing it
------
the thing about e/acc is e/anything else is inferior
------
e/acc is an inspirational ideology
------
I wonder if dumb people enjoy pretending to be smart as much as smart people enjoy being dumb
------
tweeting bangers isn’t for you it’s for all the homies to have fun in the replies

what do they call having an “ick” but if you’re a dude

as responsibilities grow I find that being able to immerse myself in a new project / idea is harder than it used to be. this also makes me less likely to attempt new things because the point of effort where momentum takes over is never reached. only solution I’ve found for this… Show more
