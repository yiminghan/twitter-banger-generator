the greatest (most entertaining and awesome) LK99 replication effort is underway on Twitter, being done in the open, by hobbyist? anime pfp Russian geniuses in a small facility, tweeting to a few hundred people. and it's bearing fruit. 

i'll never quit this app

Here's a chunk of pyrolytic graphite on the same magnet with the same stick. Even with less density and more surface normal to field.... It doesn't lift off.
If it's diamagnetism it's a fucking absurdly strong one
------
inject this shit right into my veins honestly
------
I don't separate my science and my fun.
Otherwise your fun becomes witless and your science joyless.
And then you die. Badly.
------
LK 99 is real and it's spectacular
------
sucks you cant just be good one time and then have everyone think you're a good guy who's good, forever. you have to wake up and keeping being good. every single day. this is fucked

are these superconducters in the room temperature with us right now?

not a dad, but everything i've read about parenting makes it sound insanely easy

the point of my account is to make respectable machine learning scientists see boosted tweets from "PowerBottomDad" and "BreastMilkEnjoyer" in their feed

one great thing about Oppenheimer (2023) that most people aren't talking about is how the entire thing sucked enormous ass for 3 hours. seriously what was the point of that movie. why was it in Imax?? 99% of the movie is dudes talking in a room
------
aside from any feelings of how I thought Oppenheimer was misrepresented, I just don't understand the directing style. why was it told in flashbacks and so extremely choppy. barely any real character development. hard to follow for no reason at all. anti climactic. just bizarre.
------
i hate being this rude lol. there were a lot of excellent things in the film. the acting was wonderful. dialogue and cinematography had beautiful moments.  i guess i just wanted that bomb shit and it wasn't really a bomb movie

i don't care about productivity hacks or whatever but one thing i've done in last few years that's actually had an impact is just turning off every single fucking notification. you don't need it. you check your phone enough. sure you'll miss a text once in a while. thats okay

it's too bad San Francisco is a derelict, dangerous shit hole or I might have had a perfect bluebird day walking around Golden Gate park, drinking a beer at a free concert, going to the Ansel Adams exhibit at the De Young museum, and smelling the roses in the garden. alas

golden gate park is better than central park

worst part about the San Francisco social scene is easily: the women. if we could just get the remaining 25 women to leave here it would be a human paradise. nothing but dudes yelling at their computers not a lady in sight. perfection

it's cool that everyone tweets the same thing as everyone else. that there's only 2-3 new thoughts across the entire internet each day. we're all experiencing the exact same shit. feels nice
------
vibecamp camp was really great but it would have been alot better if i had been there to experience it
------
a million dollars is, to me, the number one most beautiful thing in the world. a babys laughter or whatever is barely in the top thousand
------
power bottom dad is for the fathers. God bless you all

pro tip: if you're every thinking of telling a story about how you were high as fuck, don't tell it. it's the worst story of all time. no one wants to hear it. every story like this is exactly the same and theyre all terrible
------
its friday night in Las Vegas so you know what that means. it's time to do some growing


@growing_daniel

were gonna have our own vibecamp. with blackjack octopus and ceviche

so great to see this from Sequoia capital but you know what else would be great for American defense? if they stopped funding Chinese companies en masse haha

 So excited to share @sequoia’s first hardware defense partnership 

Alongside @shaunmmaguire, we are excited to work with @ethan_thorn2003 on @Mach_Industries:

so i get that the cops in SF will spit on your face if you call them about a carjacking or w/e. but why don't all the people carry guns? genuine question. if this is really a doom spiral like Detroit, you should know a lot of the Detroiters who stayed got pitbulls and shotguns
------
i get that nobody wants to shoot anybody (i also don't want people getting shot). but if houses on my street are regularly getting broken into, i'm buying a gun. p much all there is too it
------
does anyone have examples of the opposite, people getting sentenced for self-dense of property type situations in SF? i get everyone assumes you will be extremely stung by the law but i'd like to see/hear of some examples, sincerely

You're probably wondering how Prighozin was able to move so fast. 

That's right, he had the help of ChatGPT!

Here's 10 prompts to help you overthrow the treasonous miscreants that have been ruining the motherland:


------
the Christian God or bust
------
why do you guys say all that weird stuff
------
i still can't really believe chatGPT exists. i  would pay a million dollars for it. i love it. you can fuckin talk to the computer now
------
everyone on twitter is so succesful and hard to impress. i need to switch to a platform of fucking losers
------
it's cool that everyone tweets the same thing as everyone else. that there's only 2-3 new thoughts across the entire internet each day. we're all experiencing the exact same shit. feels nice
------
vibecamp camp was really great but it would have been alot better if i had been there to experience it
------
a million dollars is, to me, the number one most beautiful thing in the world. a babys laughter or whatever is barely in the top thousand
------
power bottom dad is for the fathers. God bless you all
------
pro tip: if you're every thinking of telling a story about how you were high as fuck, don't tell it. it's the worst story of all time. no one wants to hear it. every story like this is exactly the same and theyre all terrible
------
its friday night in Las Vegas so you know what that means. it's time to do some growing


@growing_daniel
 
@TiffanyFong_
------
were gonna have our own vibecamp. with blackjack octopus and ceviche

------
 So excited to share @sequoia’s first hardware defense partnership

so i get that the cops in SF will spit on your face if you call them about a carjacking or w/e. but why don't all the people carry guns? genuine question. if this is really a doom spiral like Detroit, you should know a lot of the Detroiters who stayed got pitbulls and shotguns
------
i get that nobody wants to shoot anybody (i also don't want people getting shot). but if houses on my street are regularly getting broken into, i'm buying a gun. p much all there is too it
------
does anyone have examples of the opposite, people getting sentenced for self-dense of property type situations in SF? i get everyone assumes you will be extremely stung by the law but i'd like to see/hear of some examples, sincerely

if you're off twitter for like a week you might as well retire. everythings changed and you'll never understand it again
------
instagram gf except instead of a selfie she stops to take a picture of a rock every 30 seconds
------

------
this concludes my rock posting, thank you
------
writing an apple vision pro app that uses advanced eye tracking to detect what youre seeing when youre drunk driving and augmenting your vision so you stay in the lanes and making 1 billion dollars before getting pulled out of my car and beaten to death at a MADD march
------
one thing about the vision pro I haven't seen mentioned: Apple products are often a fashion statement, and ski goggles have already been proven out as a fashion statement by rappers. i'm sure they were aware of this, and i expect cultural icons will create immense demand this way
------
they should make a coffee that's in my mouth
------
is las vegas the last place in America where you can quickly build a bunch of dumb shit just because it's awesome?

i can't shake the feeling now that we're all in The Great Pretending. of course there are still products, innovations, and money to be made, but I have a hard time seeing how AI will not obselete those in 5-10 years, maybe sooner. billions of people going through the motions...
------
...of a productive life. and necessarily so! but the future of everyones productivity will be decided by a few hundred or thousand people, as it always has been. this time maybe for good. a grand finale
------
alotta people are taking this as a negative thing, and maybe it is for people who derive value from career accomplishments or whatever. of course i care about doing a good job but relationships have always been my primary source of fulfillment, and i think those will flourish
------
the amount of people already up in arms calling the vision pro super dystopian and insane basically guarantee it will be a hit. feeling extremely bullish on apple
------
i get this is kind of a dumb question as there doesn't need to be significant feature advantage with apple products. the ol' apple polish can create an entirely more worthwhile product than previous iterations with same features, but i am curious
------
i have recently become insanely
bullish on the Apple Vision Pro
------
not sold on vision pro but also not a hater. actual question for enthusiasts tho: what are main advantages of vision pro over the quest pro? or even quest 3. is it just like higher res display and apple integrations?
------
idk how this keeps happening really but i'm up like 2k again. up 6k in cash in a week (down 2k at tournaments). viva las vegas
------
goodnight. i love you

aaaaaand i'm up 3500 today. back to back best ever cash sessions

i don't really know what my tweets are about anymore
------
a similar thing happened with Tesla. rappers and other cultural icons not only rapped about Tesla/autopilot/electric cars, they also featured them in music videos, driving desire for these products. winning the cultural acceptance war is a huge part of creating a hit product imo
------
when you're for the people, you threaten the powers that be. 

hey 
@elonmusk
, where's the free speech for my giant white ass? i didn't do shit!! i'm innocentr as fuck!!
------
i can't shake the feeling now that we're all in The Great Pretending. of course there are still products, innovations, and money to be made, but I have a hard time seeing how AI will not obselete those in 5-10 years, maybe sooner. billions of people going through the motions...
------
...of a productive life. and necessarily so! but the future of everyones productivity will be decided by a few hundred or thousand people, as it always has been. this time maybe for good. a grand finale
------
alotta people are taking this as a negative thing, and maybe it is for people who derive value from career accomplishments or whatever. of course i care about doing a good job but relationships have always been my primary source of fulfillment, and i think those will flourish
------
the amount of people already up in arms calling the vision pro super dystopian and insane basically guarantee it will be a hit. feeling extremely bullish on apple
------
i get this is kind of a dumb question as there doesn't need to be significant feature advantage with apple products. the ol' apple polish can create an entirely more worthwhile product than previous iterations with same features, but i am curious
------
i have recently become insanely
bullish on the Apple Vision Pro
------
not sold on vision pro but also not a hater. actual question for enthusiasts tho: what are main advantages of vision pro over the quest pro? or even quest 3. is it just like higher res display and apple integrations?
------
idk how this keeps happening really but i'm up like 2k again. up 6k in cash in a week (down 2k at tournaments). viva las vegas
------
goodnight. i love you
------
aaaaaand i'm up 3500 today. back to back best ever cash sessions
------
i'm up around 1500 at the horseshoe 3/5 if anyone wants to thru. drink required to sit down tho
------
i lied im up 2600
------
goodnight. i love you
------
i love las vegas and i intend to die here
------
all of this is for free just happening several times a night
------
double double animal style just pops out of a fountain. magical place
------
excuse me bro, is your wife bothering you?

and so it begins
------
how come everyone always talks about what happens on the strip and not how beautiful the mountains look from my parking garage
------
up 1200 in 20 mins. good omen or using up my luck too fast?

1 week PTO got me forgetting what my job is. who i am. why i chose this line of work? i could have done something noble, like become a chess streamer on youtube

i'm kidding. building technology is the only thing that matters

90 degrees? 90% humidity? no matter. hike 5 miles through the muddy jungle mountains and arrive at the incredible Nauyaca waterfalls and natural pools. maybe propose to the girl who everyone already thinks your married too. have a perfect day. God is good. love y'all
------
hot and sweaty and on an adventure just like we like it

thanks for all the love. i mean it when i say i love you too. twitter has been such a blessing for me

after much contemplation, i guess the point of Fight Club was: "why work jobs you hate to buy a bunch of shit you don't need when you could punch your friends in the face for free"

would never do an Ad but have to shoutout to selinas hostels. if you want to make friends and have money just go stay at one, like this in one manuel antonio, CR. theres an endless stream of fun interesting adventurous nice people looking to hang out. they provide activities...
------
like bonfires, hikes, welcome drinks, yoga, coworking spaces and pool. restaurants in house and near by, staff is friendly. it's just a really great product and you can make friends in a few days that will last a life time. theres even cheap long term options. try it out

i've never actually heard an argument that made sense to me in regards too what humans will actually do with their lives after robots take all the jobs. like wouldn't a bunch of people die along the way?

nevertheless i remain super optimistic! we'll figure it out haha

to be clear i'm not really talking about how we will spend our time, i think we can easily entertain ourselves to death. more so how society will transition to joblessness. who's going to pay for the humans who's jobs are obseleted en masse?

thanks for all your suggestions here gang i've already heard them and haven't changed my mind one bit

managers get clowned on a lot, often rightfully so, but honestly i have so much respect for anyone who decides to step into a management position. it can feel like an unwinnable job with no way to affect change. coding alone is alot more fun than whatever the hell it is that i do

i think Bing being totally batshit insane is cool and good and mostly harmless. let's start the conversation right now, humanity. how do we deal robots flyin off the handle? what happens if russia and china use them as maliciously as possible? clocks ticking

to be fair this is a step up from the guy at my last job who literally did 0 all year (didn't know how to code or care to try) but was kept on due to being on a "rotation" (and was happily sent on to the next team)

it's my favorite god damn thing in the world. i could do this for a 1000 years
------
and for the main course
------
wyd rn
------
one thing thats might be fun is to meet an internet friend that you get along with really well and just be really nice too them and just hangout with them for a few weeks before asking to borrow 9000 dollars just to see what they say
------
btw can anyone help me out. i'll pay you back fr in like a month
------
crazy how girls want you to be fun and exciting. not me dude. i don't say shit. barely blink. monotone voice. never smile. take it or leave it
------
sorry sweetie, daddy and mommy don't have a college fund for you because they had to spend 14,000 dollars a year on take out each of the 9 years they were still deciding to have kids
------
yes of course we love you! you just have to understand we also love the fresh yellowfin tuna at a chefs choice japanese omakase tasting menu 5 times a month. one day you'll get that
------
i posted another normie tech article, i've sold out. for free

crazy how writing one mid blog post doesn't immediately turn you into Noah Smith, or even like Roon
------
i've never actually heard an argument that made sense to me in regards too what humans will actually do with their lives after robots take all the jobs. like wouldn't a bunch of people die along the way?

nevertheless i remain super optimistic! we'll figure it out haha
------
to be clear i'm not really talking about how we will spend our time, i think we can easily entertain ourselves to death. more so how society will transition to joblessness. who's going to pay for the humans who's jobs are obseleted en masse?
------
thanks for all your suggestions here gang i've already heard them and haven't changed my mind one bit
------
managers get clowned on a lot, often rightfully so, but honestly i have so much respect for anyone who decides to step into a management position. it can feel like an unwinnable job with no way to affect change. coding alone is alot more fun than whatever the hell it is that i do
------
i think Bing being totally batshit insane is cool and good and mostly harmless. let's start the conversation right now, humanity. how do we deal robots flyin off the handle? what happens if russia and china use them as maliciously as possible? clocks ticking
------
to be fair this is a step up from the guy at my last job who literally did 0 all year (didn't know how to code or care to try) but was kept on due to being on a "rotation" (and was happily sent on to the next team)
------
gonna delete this now so i dont get doxxed and fired thanks
------
being sad is fine as long as you snap the fuck out of it real quick
------
literally everyone including the media is talking about how no one is talking about the train blowing up
------
not much of an NFL guy but i've actually been really enjoying this superbowl
------
maybe the aliens had never considered an American made Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor tactical fighter jet
------
man it would suck if they were trying to gift us the secrets of the universe and they sent it by balloon because thats the tech we had 120 years ago when they launched the mission haha
------
just had a religious experience at golden diner, new york. the mushroom gochujang sauce on the burger is unreal

so yeah i'm thinking the youth is gonna be just fine
------
some people are fucking beggin to be unhappy. theyre craving it. they dont even know what being happy looks like. if they ever got it they would be unhappy about it. would complain to anyone who would listen about how much they hate a happy life
------
twitter is doing fine. you might disagree. you might even have evidence to the contrary. like how u cant load notifiations or log in on desktop. but let me ask you. is it worth getting shadowbanned by Elon Musk himself for talking shit?? twitter is doing fine

if it works for you thats cool. but as my ol pal marcus aurelius would say, "waste no more time arguing what a good man should be and go be one", or whatever

------
some people are fucking beggin to be unhappy. theyre craving it. they dont even know what being happy looks like. if they ever got it they would be unhappy about it. would complain to anyone who would listen about how much they hate a happy life
------
twitter is doing fine. you might disagree. you might even have evidence to the contrary. like how u cant load notifiations or log in on desktop. but let me ask you. is it worth getting shadowbanned by Elon Musk himself for talking shit?? twitter is doing fine
------
just got airport hammered and got chatted up by a bloke who happened to be from alaska (i lived there 4 years) and he bought my whole tab (4 double whiskey ginger ales). we've both been to 20+ countries. humanity is fuckin incredible. i cant tell you how much i love this world
------
everyday above ground is a good day amen?
------
if you can't say something nice just log off and try again tomorrow
------

-defontes
-court street grocer
-cheeky sandwiches
-alidoro?

please post any sandwich bangers you love
------
also if anyone wants to get a sandwich this weekend hit me up
------
woke up and merged code
------

-advent of the internet
-smart phones
-electric car/sdc explosion
-global travel become commonplace
-landing rockets
-content creation explosion
-mainstream solar
-thinking machines

HOW INCREDIBLE!
------
-fusion become viable??
-solving protein folding?
-mrna technology?
-crispr/cas9 become prevelant?
-satelite internet become cheap
-drone technology
-3d printing
-carbon sequestration tech?
-virtual reality made cheap and amazing
-proliferation of robotics?
-personalized edtech??
------
gas stove current thing discourse a new low for twitter. just absolutely boring, who gives a shit content
------
we are all better than this, probably
------
if thats your man how come he has wide child bearing hips
------
i think i'm not as afraid of quitting / failing / going broke as alotta people because i've been broke a bunch and still had such a great time. only real issue is medical emergencies. it's my opinion everyone should spend some time getting comfortable being broke
------
in some ways it's actually more fun because you do less consumption hobbies and are forced to be creative with your leisure. lotta walks exploring everywhere and learning and exercise and writing
------
this is obv all different if u have people to support
------
you think you need a lot. but you really just need your health. and hopefully some friends
------
the secret to making rice beans and broccoli taste great is fasting for 40 hours before you eat it
------
some days i get sad because i'll never be an important computer genius and other days i'm elated that the industry has expanded enough for my dumbass to take part in it and make a comfortable life for myself. also who cares
------
with Andrew Tate in Romanian prison were going to need a new guy who sucks total ass to be a role model for these kids
------
How I Went From 1100 to 2100 at Bullet Chess As An Adult Without Studying 
------
I played 100,000 games or so over ten years. There are no secrets to life. Just put in the time, the rest will come.
------
they should shorten the weekend. i miss work too much. hurry up Monday this basically useless data pipeline aint going to code itself
------
i literally can't believe people ( especially those close to the AI industry ) still believe AGI is a pipe dream lol. what could possibly convince them at this point? i guess it could be better at every single task and they'd still deny it
------
The bull case is that generative AI becomes a widespread UX paradigm for interacting with most tech products (note: this has nothing to do with AGI, which is a pipe dream). Near-future iterations of current AI models become our interface to the world's information.

Mr Beast confirms my long held suspicion that if Billionaires want people to like them all they have to do is hand out bags of cash like Pablo Escobar when they walk around. would be absurdly cheap vs some lame failure of marketing campaign. 

please more people do this

there's no way twitter can track views accurately lol. what do they have a freaking camera watching my eyes to see if i viewed it?? i'm not viewing shit. get real
------
has anyone actually made a bucket list? what's the sickest thing on there??

3 days from break. slack is barely buzzing. everyone quietly pretending to work. nothing getting done. you log off early. you hit the gym even tho you don't want to. stairclimber. light snack, shower. joint on the porch. you're happy, satisfied. it's Christmas. what's not to love

NEW: Elon Musk said he would cut nearly 75 percent of Twitter's staff if he takes control, far deeper cuts than the company's current leadership has proposed. The initial cuts would target lower performers, who scored less than a 3 on performance reviews. https://washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/10/20/musk-twitter-acquisition-staff-cuts/…

tech people are really gonna preach "move fast and break things" for a whole ass decade and then turn their back on Elon the first week he starts doing exactly that smh
------
also please someone tell me what is broken. i literally hvent noticed any difference except its seems more active
------
twitter can easily get 5-10x worse without having to worry about losing its base. there is simply no where else to go
------
People really have no imagination. Elon is playing the long game. Soon you'll be able to use Twitter while driving your Tesla. On Mars.
------
I'm an Elon Musk Maximalist. I think his dad jokes tweets are hilarious. I think buying Twitter was a good business decision. I think self driving cars are coming next year. I think that old scuba diver guy in Thailand was actually a pedophile.

this is all 100% true btw
