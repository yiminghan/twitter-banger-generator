harsh truth about stable diffusion:

diffusion models are in this weird place right now where they're incredible if you curate their output, but nowhere near reliable enough to use on-the-fly as a core component of a generative game.

3/ Lumina is also an invaluable tool for developers.

It displays rich information such as instruction data, CPIs, and transaction logs.
------
1/ I've been writing a lot of Typescript recently and realized something.

Typescript is approachable to so many developers because it achieves an elegant balance between two styles of programming: data-first and procedure-first.
------
3/ In contrast, languages like Rust or Java require that types be defined before they can even be used in procedures.

In these languages, types serve as the source of truth and procedures are used to manipulate data from one type to another.
------
4/ IMO, Typescript is approachable because it accommodates both styles.

Some TS devs write input/output types for each function before defining the function body, as in Rust.

Others write few types and let libraries/inference do all of the heavy lifting, as in plain JS.
------
LMFAO the Solana MEV spammers are finally profitable because some rando exchange MarcoPolo started doing Swap2Earn 
------
Solana MEV searcher fails a $1 arbitrage lol
------
People often underrate how essential beautiful + intuitive UX is for user-facing product success.

This is the biggest untapped edge IMO in building a product in some verticals.
------
Typescript's developer experience is mind blowing these days.

We're quickly approaching the point where it should be considered a top choice for everything other than performance-critical code.

Most programming languages can learn from the Typescript community's relentless focus on optimizing the developer experience.
------
A common failure path I see in some devtools, especially 'No Code' solutions:

They make the easy things easier but the hard things exponentially harder.

Sure, I could use a tool to avoid having to write 10 lines of code... but that wasn't the hard part.

@Lumina_Labs


A new project to make Solana transactions more readable for everyday users.

 developers will be able to use the one-line lumina() utility to debug tests.

- simple setup, just npm install and add lumina() to test
- spins up a local Lumina instance for localnet
- displays live transaction feed as your test runs
------
5/ Roadmap ahead


@jito_labs
 - mempool visualizer and MEV analytics

@solana
 - display verified source code for programs

@heliuslabs
 - transaction parsing integration

@anchorlang
 - parsed before/after account data for localnet txs
------
3/ Lumina is also an invaluable tool for developers.

It displays rich information such as instruction data, CPIs, and transaction logs.
------
1/ I've been writing a lot of Typescript recently and realized something.

Typescript is approachable to so many developers because it achieves an elegant balance between two styles of programming: data-first and procedure-first.
------
3/ In contrast, languages like Rust or Java require that types be defined before they can even be used in procedures.

In these languages, types serve as the source of truth and procedures are used to manipulate data from one type to another.
------
4/ IMO, Typescript is approachable because it accommodates both styles.

Some TS devs write input/output types for each function before defining the function body, as in Rust.

Others write few types and let libraries/inference do all of the heavy lifting, as in plain JS.
------
LMFAO the Solana MEV spammers are finally profitable because some rando exchange MarcoPolo started doing Swap2Earn 
------
Solana MEV searcher fails a $1 arbitrage lol
------
People often underrate how essential beautiful + intuitive UX is for user-facing product success.

This is the biggest untapped edge IMO in building a product in some verticals.
------
Typescript's developer experience is mind blowing these days.

We're quickly approaching the point where it should be considered a top choice for everything other than performance-critical code.

I think Solana is interesting for MEV searchers right now because it's mostly a latency auction (as opposed to a gas auction).

This means searchers keep *all* of the profits, which are quite substantial (~$45M in first half of 2022)

highlights:
~ $45M in profits extracted from arbitrages and liquidations in 2022
- as much as 25% of blockspace on Solana has been spent on MEV

Woah, 
@ameliatastic
's code for Seahorse is absolutely insane under the hood.

In the transformation step, it constructs a completely valid Rust program from the python/seahorse AST... wtf.

Why the fuck do Chrome extensions automatically install remote updates lmao
------
There's something especially morbid about just watching the bridge funds get slowly sucked out of the contract every block...
------
Someone should make an on-chain contract that lets you split one ETH into one ETHPOW and one ETHPOS to allow people to trade them early.

After the merge happens, you can redeem ETHPOW for 1 ETH on the ETHPOW chain and ETHPOS for 1 ETH on the ETHPOS chain.
------
L1s should *maximize* long-term MEV.

An approximation for this is maximizing MEV while minimizing its negative externalities on end users, lest they leave and cause a net decrease in long-term MEV.

Importantly, this should not be confused with minimizing MEV.

I think this is a good display of the fact that these models are ultimately just constant-time functions (albeit with a very large constant)

It's difficult for them to solve problems that require 'thinking' in higher-degree time complexity.

ChatGPT does not seem capable of general purpose reasoning, and seems to make basic elementary logical errors on even relatively simple questions. Sometimes its own explanation even directly contradicts itself.

Video games are essentially simulations for time-sensitive, strategic decision-making in a high-pressure environment.

It's hard to get extensive practice in these kinds of situations anywhere else in life outside of a few exceptions (e.g. high-frequency trading).

Some thoughts on the recent 
@Uniswap
 LP profitability discussions...

I think the markout pnl metric doesn't make sense in the context of AMM LPs.
------
On markout PnL...

Systematic traders commonly use markout PnL as one metric to estimate the profitability of their trades.

------
I'm not making a statement on whether or not LPing is profitable for the median Uniswap user. Just wanted to point out something that might be worth taking a closer look at :).
------
Of course, this is a complicated and nuanced topic over which many smart people disagree with each other. I could be totally wrong!
------
What's interesting about 
@seahorse_lang
 is that, while its syntax is Python, it obeys Rust's statically-typed semantics: it'll tell you at compile time if the wrong type is used somewhere, etc

Pretty fascinating that can it can basically deliver the same level of safety as Rust.

I think Solana is interesting for MEV searchers right now because it's mostly a latency auction (as opposed to a gas auction).

This means searchers keep *all* of the profits, which are quite substantial (~$45M in first half of 2022)
------
highlights:
~ $45M in profits extracted from arbitrages and liquidations in 2022
- as much as 25% of blockspace on Solana has been spent on MEV
- the median arb profit is 1 cent (!!!)
- the median liquidation profit is $2.85
------
It's kind of ridiculous how under-discussed AI risk is amongst populations of people typically perceived as 'smart' e.g. FAANG engineers.

It would be cool to see on-chain AI used for things like generating game levels for crypto games.

There's also a ton of room to improve accuracy -- Sea-NN is far from perfect.

If you're young and ambitious, apply to Alameda Research. There is no better place to work, hands down.

from what i can tell, ftx/alameda seems to be pretty good at promoting people internally vs hiring outside executives to run major parts of their business

Woah, 
@ameliatastic
's code for Seahorse is absolutely insane under the hood.

In the transformation step, it constructs a completely valid Rust program from the python/seahorse AST... wtf.

Why the fuck do Chrome extensions automatically install remote updates lmao
------
There's something especially morbid about just watching the bridge funds get slowly sucked out of the contract every block...
------
Someone should make an on-chain contract that lets you split one ETH into one ETHPOW and one ETHPOS to allow people to trade them early.

After the merge happens, you can redeem ETHPOW for 1 ETH on the ETHPOW chain and ETHPOS for 1 ETH on the ETHPOS chain.
------
L1s should *maximize* long-term MEV.

An approximation for this is maximizing MEV while minimizing its negative externalities on end users, lest they leave and cause a net decrease in long-term MEV.

Importantly, this should not be confused with minimizing MEV.

Noticed some transactions with the new ComputeBudget instruction landing top of block

The team at Jito Labs is excited to announce the first Solana-focused MEV dashboard!

1) Some thoughts on factors that may lead to monopolistic pricing for blockspace...

One reason is synchronous composability.

I think another important one is legibility.

For blockspace to be valuable, it should be transparent, introspectable, auditable, etc.
------
4/ Commoditized blockspace happens if we build good async primitives and apps are aggressive to move capital to the cheapest chain

In this world, all L1 tokens become near worthless anyway. (Your crypto portfolio is diversified with app layer exposure, right anon?)
------
2) Ethereum blockspace is extremely legible: the community has built tons of great GUIs and tools to examine the chain.

Alt L1 blockspace feels opaque (non-EVM L1s in particular). Their explorers and tools are often underdeveloped -- if a tree were to fall, nobody would hear it.
------
3) Legibility also impacts value accrual to L1 token holders

Less legible blockspace leads to MEV extraction being dominated by a few sophisticated players

More legible blockspace leads to more competition in extraction, driving value to block producers (hence token holders)
------
Solana Fee Markets and NFT Mints

Localized fee markets on Solana will be a forcing function for top Solana NFT protocols to optimize the mechanisms and parallelism of their contracts.

Some explorations on how this might go...
------
One crude approach to parallelizing is to pre mint vouchers and deposit them into a few 'state shards' which users can mint from. Then the dapp frontend can randomly choose a shard to mint from and the vouchers can be redeemed for the NFTs afterwards.
------
It will surely be exciting to see how protocols adapt given that they've never been forced to think about such tradeoffs in the past.

Perhaps this will even make room for new launchpads to capture marketshare from the incumbents?

Solana governance systems should adopt measures against "just in time" voting attacks.

Currently, someone is able to deposit tokens in the last block of a vote, crank it, then withdraw.

This is especially abusable since leaders produce 4 blocks each time they are selected.

Solana's on-chain timestamp has been desynced, it's currently 30 minutes (!!) behind.

Time manipulation is concerning because a huge amount of MEV can be extracted by validators by exploiting this (NFT mints, IDOs, etc.)

How does a vAMM realistically deal with the price of an underlying going to 0?

1. Settling the market at 0 means the protocol blows up (has to take on all outstanding pnl as debt).

L1s vs Apps

I fear that, in the future, most on-chain protocols will fit into one of two categories:

Woah, 
@ameliatastic
's code for Seahorse is absolutely insane under the hood.

In the transformation step, it constructs a completely valid Rust program from the python/seahorse AST... wtf.

One of the most impressive Rust projects I've ever seen

https://github.com/ameliatastic/seahorse-lang/blob/main/src/core/to_seahorse_ast/transform.rs…
------
1) introducing @seahorse_lang!

seahorse is a framework for developing solana programs in python, built on @anchorlang

Why the fuck do Chrome extensions automatically install remote updates lmao
------
There's something especially morbid about just watching the bridge funds get slowly sucked out of the contract every block...
------
Someone should make an on-chain contract that lets you split one ETH into one ETHPOW and one ETHPOS to allow people to trade them early.

After the merge happens, you can redeem ETHPOW for 1 ETH on the ETHPOW chain and ETHPOS for 1 ETH on the ETHPOS chain.
------
L1s should *maximize* long-term MEV.

An approximation for this is maximizing MEV while minimizing its negative externalities on end users, lest they leave and cause a net decrease in long-term MEV.

Importantly, this should not be confused with minimizing MEV.

1) Some thoughts on factors that may lead to monopolistic pricing for blockspace...

One reason is synchronous composability.

I think another important one is legibility.

For blockspace to be valuable, it should be transparent, introspectable, auditable, etc.
------
4/ Commoditized blockspace happens if we build good async primitives and apps are aggressive to move capital to the cheapest chain

In this world, all L1 tokens become near worthless anyway. (Your crypto portfolio is diversified with app layer exposure, right anon?)
------
2) Ethereum blockspace is extremely legible: the community has built tons of great GUIs and tools to examine the chain.

Alt L1 blockspace feels opaque (non-EVM L1s in particular). Their explorers and tools are often underdeveloped -- if a tree were to fall, nobody would hear it.
------
3) Legibility also impacts value accrual to L1 token holders

Less legible blockspace leads to MEV extraction being dominated by a few sophisticated players

More legible blockspace leads to more competition in extraction, driving value to block producers (hence token holders)
------
Solana Fee Markets and NFT Mints

Localized fee markets on Solana will be a forcing function for top Solana NFT protocols to optimize the mechanisms and parallelism of their contracts.

Some explorations on how this might go...
------
One crude approach to parallelizing is to pre mint vouchers and deposit them into a few 'state shards' which users can mint from. Then the dapp frontend can randomly choose a shard to mint from and the vouchers can be redeemed for the NFTs afterwards.
------
It will surely be exciting to see how protocols adapt given that they've never been forced to think about such tradeoffs in the past.

Perhaps this will even make room for new launchpads to capture marketshare from the incumbents?
------
Another idea is to better parallelize the minting protocols.

As far as I understand, most contracts require the mint instructions to occur sequentially and therefore cannot be parallelized at all.
------
Privacy is absurdly underrated as an essential blockchain technology.

You simply cannot disrupt the legacy financial system if anyone can see someone else's purchases, salaries, net worths, student loans, etc.
------
Web3 attracts talented builders because it rapidly embraces new technologies

e.g. The opportunity to use Rust at most web2 companies is pretty limited / nonexistent

I think DYDX's choice to build an appchain (vs Eth L2) comes down to tooling.

There are no tools to make custom Ethereum L2s.

There ARE tools to make custom appchain L1s.

I don't think ideological differences between alt L1s and eth L2s are the main concern.
------
I should clarify that there are tools to make *centralized* Ethereum L2s (e.g. Starkware, what DYDX is currently using).
------
Does anyone have metrics on how much SOL is currently used for rent exemptions and how much this number is increasing per day?

Given the rent costs and how rarely people reclaim rent, I feel like this could grow to be a nontrivial amount of SOL/year that is effectively locked.

The real bull case for Defi apps becoming their own interoperable app-specific L1s is to capture the value created by protocol MEV.

Few understand this.

Alpha leak

Never trust APYs on GUIs, calculate them yourself
------
PSA to top tier auditors that Solana audits go for $250K+ and there is probably a backlog of at least 10 teams that are looking for formal audits.
------
How does a vAMM realistically deal with the price of an underlying going to 0?

1. Settling the market at 0 means the protocol blows up (has to take on all outstanding pnl as debt).
2. Attempting to repeg to 0 costs the same as above.
3. Otherwise has to pay out funding forever.

RIP to the stakers in this LUNA Put vault

Why is Hackernews so anti-crypto?

I understand that the audience skews a bit older than e.g. crypto twitter, but it's still surprising to me.

I hope I never become as intensely default-skeptical of new technologies.

Solana MEV bots literally spamming hundreds of failing arb txs...

This bot literally hasn't landed a successful arb in the last hour (probably like 0.1% success rate)

Down bad for 
@jito_labs

So what's going to happen to all of these contracts that implement bot protection via instruction sysvar (e.g. 
@metaplex
) when 
@jito_labs
 drops bundles on mainnet 
------
Now that Solana NFT MEV is dead, who's going to be the first one to leak the outdated alpha? 
------
Mempools are entirely a "userspace" construct, right?

It seems like it's possible for:

- Alternate mempools to exist for Ethereum
- Anyone to create a mempool on top of Solana
etc.

Is that correct?
------
we're looking for early beta testers to run the 
@jito_labs
 jito-solana client on testnet.

this client integrates with the Jito Block Engine and enables more efficient block building, transaction bundles, and MEV revenue sharing with stakers.

Solana Validators censoring the Metaplex contract is just MEV ;)

This is a phenomenal introduction to zero-knowledge proofs by Justin Thaler.

We've seen Solana AMMs compete themselves down to almost 0 fees at this point.

At first, 25-30bps fees. Then 4-5bps. Now 0.8bps. Yes, this is for volatile pairs like SOL/USDC!

Where do we go from here?
------
L1s vs Apps

I fear that, in the future, most on-chain protocols will fit into one of two categories:

- Semi-centralized, lack composability, web2-esque, critical components are closed source

- Highly composable, open source, extract very little value, essentially public goods
------
And I think this is why we see narratives like "subnets", "parachains", "appchains", etc come to fruition -- a lot of defi developers believe that it's the key to sustaining profits in the long run.
------
In some sense, the "make your own L1" strategy is also about bringing in sticky non-toxic flow, except this time it's in more of a "B2B" sense.

And I think all roads basically lead to that: get a long-lasting source of non-toxic flow.
------
Another way is for them to become their own L1s. This doesn't magically make the problem go away, but it allows them to do following trade:

They can extract long-term value from other protocols (building on this L1) and in exchange give them users/marketing/funding/etc.
------
Alpha leak

Look for weird contract functions and investigate wallets that are calling them.
------
Becoming convinced that most mechanisms for MEV resistance are just variations of the TWAMM.

i.e. doing things in aggregate between blocks
------
One major difference between Solana and Ethereum MEV is the surface area of potential opportunities.

On Solana, there are only a few protocols which leads to everyone fighting over the same few opportunities.
------
Competing is less about creativity and more about optimizing latency, infra, algos, access to stakeweight, CEX trading, etc.

In some sense, this makes Solana MEV more difficult for beginners who benefit from being willing to dig through obscure protocols for long-tail strats.
------
These beginners could take advantage of their creativity to make a profit without needing a sophisticated setup.

But creativity is only rewarded when there are many protocols so that you can notice something that nobody else has and extract value from it.

I think this depends on the type of venture firm you're running.

Multicoin's formula is making early, high conviction bets, and aggressively supporting their portfolio companies publicly even in the face of criticism. I can see why being anonymous might hurt their strategy.
------
Disagreed. Don’t encourage cowardice. In the long run, the best investors are the ones who are willing to be wrong in public. It is the ultimate litmus test of conviction
------
Other firms / angels have different strategies, though. For example, some firms' main value adds are building dev tooling, contributing to open source, and/or writing academic papers. For them, I think having some anonymous team members can be helpful.
------
In more technical / academic environments, being anonymous shows that you're willing to let your work stand for itself.

 Hacks 


Maybe controversial, but I think Solana actually has the potential to be one of the most secure blockchains.

This might seem a bit absurd to say given the recent hacks, but let me explain my thoughts below.


------
Overall I would say that even though Solana has had a bit of trouble recently with hacks, it's important to keep in mind that these are just growing pains.



There is light at the end of the tunnel, and I think the end state for Solana is a much safer and more secure world.

Should Anchor require that Pubkey member fields of all accounts passed to an instruction be validated in some way (or explicitly marked as not needing to be validated)?

Can Solana's leader schedule generation introduce centralization if it's not shuffled properly?

Completely random shuffling means that higher stake validators are probabilistically more likely to get access to 8/12/16+ block chunks that enable easier atomic cross-chain MEV.

Solana's Security + 
@CashioApp
 / 
@wormholecrypto
 Hacks 


Maybe controversial, but I think Solana actually has the potential to be one of the most secure blockchains.

This might seem a bit absurd to say given the recent hacks, but let me explain my thoughts below.


------
Overall I would say that even though Solana has had a bit of trouble recently with hacks, it's important to keep in mind that these are just growing pains.



There is light at the end of the tunnel, and I think the end state for Solana is a much safer and more secure world.

Should Anchor require that Pubkey member fields of all accounts passed to an instruction be validated in some way (or explicitly marked as not needing to be validated)?

------
It's possible for Solana validators to sell contracts for future blockspace due to Solana's deterministic leader schedule.

There may need to be a requirement that they post collateral that gets slashed if they drop the blocks / don't include the transaction in the 4 block chunk.

A number of closed-source Solana contracts do not publicly provide their IDLs (equivalent of Ethereum ABIs).

I think it's actually possible to extract these by reverse engineering the on-chain bytecode based on the generated Anchor code for instruction deserialization.
------
Can Solana's leader schedule generation introduce centralization if it's not shuffled properly?

Completely random shuffling means that higher stake validators are probabilistically more likely to get access to 8/12/16+ block chunks that enable easier atomic cross-chain MEV.
------
In the current epoch's 12 block chunk recipients:

Everstake - 8 (!)
Kraken - 2
Bx7S - 2
Rest - 1 or lower

The probability of getting access to these chunks increases superlinearly with higher stake.

Thoughts on Solana bundles...

Ethereum bundles are primarily used for MEV extraction (e.g. backruns and arbitrage). But on Solana, they also have another use case:

Atomic on-chain operations involving more accounts / compute than the per-transaction limits on Solana.
------
Example:

@JupiterExchange
 is a Solana aggregator that is restricted to 2 routes per trade due to Solana's transaction limits.

If they were to use bundles, they could form infinitely complex routes / route-splitting to get amazing execution prices for their users 
------
Defi 2.0 is just Defi 1.0 with better memes tbh
------
The difference is that MEV doesn't necessarily need to be an exploit; One could use symbolic execution to find an input that yields profit that is *not* a smart contract hack.

Example:
Symbolically determining that you could profitably call an autocompounder's harvest function. https://twitter.com/0xfbifemboy/status/1496230293338050573…
------
On the other hand... even though finding MEV from symbolic execution isn't necessarily the same as an exploit, finding an exploit using symbolic execution *is* necessarily MEV ;)
------
Overall I would say that even though Solana has had a bit of trouble recently with hacks, it's important to keep in mind that these are just growing pains.

Competition between StarkWare vs zkSync

Much of the narrative suggests that StarkWare and zkSync are fierce competitors due being in the zk rollup space together.

I actually think that this is completely the wrong way to think about it.

Some thoughts below 
------
Also, we see glaringly different fundraising paradigms between chains like Solana and Avax. I think StarkWare and zkSync will reflect the same dichotomy:

StarkWare - Raise hefty sums from VCs, high FDVs early on.

zkSync - More grassroots projects, less heavily VC-funded.
------
Finally, I think that as zero knowledge proof technology matures, many/most chains will utilize it in some capacity, including L1 Ethereum.

In such a world, two zk rollup chains are really just competing in the "rollup" sense rather than the "zk" one.

Thoughts on Solana bundles...

Ethereum bundles are primarily used for MEV extraction (e.g. backruns and arbitrage). But on Solana, they also have another use case:

Atomic on-chain operations involving more accounts / compute than the per-transaction limits on Solana.
------
Example:

@JupiterExchange
 is a Solana aggregator that is restricted to 2 routes per trade due to Solana's transaction limits.

If they were to use bundles, they could form infinitely complex routes / route-splitting to get amazing execution prices for their users 
------
Defi 2.0 is just Defi 1.0 with better memes tbh
------
The difference is that MEV doesn't necessarily need to be an exploit; One could use symbolic execution to find an input that yields profit that is *not* a smart contract hack.

Example:
Symbolically determining that you could profitably call an autocompounder's harvest function. https://twitter.com/0xfbifemboy/status/1496230293338050573…

On the other hand... even though finding MEV from symbolic execution isn't necessarily the same as an exploit, finding an exploit using symbolic execution *is* necessarily MEV ;)

The hacker didn't want to dump its ETH for USDC (to avoid Circle freezing their funds), so instead they used the ETH/SOL markets to dump it into SOL, making for some huge arb opportunities between SOL markets on other DEXs.

I actually challenge the claim that passive LPing is an important aspect of defi

The profitability of passive LPing was mostly due to subsidies from protocols (in the form of emissions) in the first place.

Lazy LPing

The point of an exchange isn't to give free yield to people, it's to provide the best trading prices.

Solana MEV Triple(!) Dex Arb 



This bot closed an arb across three different Solana DEXs (Mercurial, Orca, Serum) in a single transaction for a grand total of...



2.6 cents 

What's going on here? 

https://solscan.io/tx/5hdwrwgfbFDbxsigaqHEB8syYrWjaidRec96xdbP7V4BPSMuYBk8yFeq8jdWxDPgK7CYLwEV2bAgSuPbf55HGzvg…
------
Would love to chat with anyone working on ways to get more accurate historical analyses of Solana accounts! 

There is analysis to be done on more than just spot arb bots -- there are NFT drop bots, perps arb bots, market making bots, liquidity mining bots, and more 
------
That's all for now!

It will be exciting to see how the on-chain battleground  of Solana MEV evolves over 2022 as pivotal technologies such as 
@jito_labs
 come online as well as Solana fee markets are introduced
------
Overall, it seems that this bot is only modestly profitable -- most of its transactions yield very small amounts of profit.

It's hard to tell, but my rough estimates based on the SPL transfer history seem to indicate that the bot makes a few thousand dollars a month or less

Things to note:

Minor nits:

Do any stablecoin protocols based on the Collateralized Debt Position model use algorithmically determined interest rates?

------
This spilled over into more arbs across ETH, SOL, and USDC markets that a number of people were able to take advantage of.
------
How were all of these arbitrages done?

They all happened right after the Wormhole hack when the attack dumped all of its ETH on the causing huge imbalances in the markets across all of Solana

Competition between StarkWare vs zkSync

Much of the narrative suggests that StarkWare and zkSync are fierce competitors due being in the zk rollup space together.

I actually think that this is completely the wrong way to think about it.

Some thoughts below 
------
Also, we see glaringly different fundraising paradigms between chains like Solana and Avax. I think StarkWare and zkSync will reflect the same dichotomy:

StarkWare - Raise hefty sums from VCs, high FDVs early on.

zkSync - More grassroots projects, less heavily VC-funded.
------
Finally, I think that as zero knowledge proof technology matures, many/most chains will utilize it in some capacity, including L1 Ethereum.

In such a world, two zk rollup chains are really just competing in the "rollup" sense rather than the "zk" one.
------
I noticed 
@RaydiumProtocol
 uses a simulated instruction call and then scrapes its logs in order to determine the reserve quantities of a pool.

Does anyone know why it does this over fetching account data directly? Is it for more reliable query synchronization?


@AlphaRaydium
------
It's kind of absurd to see that MEV has become a term synonymous with sandwiching in uninformed crypto circles.
------
The most based thing I heard during my time at 
@AlamedaResearch


"You only incur impermanent loss if you're not the one that arbs the pool"
------
I think eventually there will be a semi-centralized on-chain reputation network that many smart contracts will use to prevent / chargeback transactions. Like tradfi, but transparent.

I just don't see crypto reaching mass adoption without such safeguards for your average user.
------
The smart contact is revolutionary and its benefits outweigh its drawbacks, but events like these should be a reminder that it’s objectively hazardous for a raw function interface to a financial program to be completely open source and open access.

@LockeProtocol
 just dropped and uses some ideas I've been thinking about for a while since 
@_Dave__White_
 first released the TWAMM

Writing a  on my thoughts
- Mechanism Design
- MEV Resistance
- Relationship to TWAMM
- Efficiency
------
TLDR of @LockeProtocol:

- fair and efficient token distribution
- unsophisticated users don't get rekt
- MEV resistant
- no gas wars
- composable AF
------
Efficiency

The mechanism design lends itself to having great efficiency. The sale is not instantaneous, so there is ample time for price discovery.

Whenever new TVL is added/removed from the pool, there is time for other participants to adjust their deposit quantities.

------
In fact, LockeProtocol is a special case of the TWAMM

- The auctioned rewards tokens are like the tokens being sold
- The staked deposit tokens are like the tokens being bought
- The users participating in the auction are like the LPs in the pool.
------
Unpopular Opinion:

Most defi protocols should delay launching a token and, in the meanwhile, redirect all protocol profits to an internal vault.

Only once this vault reaches $1m (or some other reasonable threshold) should the token be launched.
------
Totally agree with this.

It's pretty impressive to see how little time it takes for the best founders to crank out features, allowing them to focus on learning from users / growing their product in other ways. https://twitter.com/tanoaksam/status/1493984156560330753…

It's pretty interesting to see how CLOBs and AMMs have converged over time.

CLOBs like Serum have spawned composing projects that offer AMM-like liquidity provision strategies (like Raydium) and AMMs like Uniswap have transitioned to requiring more active LP participation.
------
Has anyone explored bytecode analysis of closed-source Solana programs?

DMs are open!
------
We need a new term 'FEV' - fork extractable value
------
Due to increasing regulatory pressure for projects to become decentralized as soon as possible after their launch, I think most projects will be forced to go open source eventually.

DAOs can't be closed source, as they cannot really accept protocol contributions otherwise.
------
1. It's obvious to me OS is better for the health of our industry and crypto ideals. 2. I think it's also privately beneficial to the project itself but this is a bit more debatable. We have to convince people of the second point for things to really change

I parsed 1 million Raydium swap transactions for a quick and dirty analysis of just a fraction of the onchain atomic arbs taking place on

Optimism / Arbitrum Alpha Leak

I believe one can write wrapper contracts over L2 optimistic rollup DEXs (e.g. Uni V3) with better calldata compression to achieve lower gas fees.

Unfortunately, this is not true; there are already backroom deals in which searchers pay validators for privileged access to their blockspace.

The devs should have considered if these upgrades patch vulnerabilities that are currently exploitable, but given the magnitude of changes, I can see why it would be difficult.

Solana Compute Model MEV Implications

Solana transaction fees do not scale with compute, unlike Ethereum

Bots are free to do calculations based on the latest blockchain state *within* their contract without sacrificing profits, enabling more optimized value extraction!

A few tips on onboarding quickly to solana:
- Don’t start with Anchor, you’ll probably get confused. It’s useful to know what Anchor is abstracting away, so first try building something without it. This is a good starting point: https://paulx.dev/blog/2021/01/14/programming-on-solana-an-introduction/…

I actually challenge the claim that passive LPing is an important aspect of defi

The profitability of passive LPing was mostly due to subsidies from protocols (in the form of emissions) in the first place.
------
uni v3 has been great for traders, but at the expense of destroying one of the most important aspects of defi:

Lazy LPing

The point of an exchange isn't to give free yield to people, it's to provide the best trading prices.

The ones that are not competitive on that front (which requires active MMs) will eventually be competed away.

Solana MEV Triple(!) Dex Arb 



This bot closed an arb across three different Solana DEXs (Mercurial, Orca, Serum) in a single transaction for a grand total of...



2.6 cents 

What's going on here?

Would love to chat with anyone working on ways to get more accurate historical analyses of Solana accounts! 

There is analysis to be done on more than just spot arb bots -- there are NFT drop bots, perps arb bots, market making bots, liquidity mining bots, and more

That's all for now!

It will be exciting to see how the on-chain battleground  of Solana MEV evolves over 2022 as pivotal technologies such as 
@jito_labs

Overall, it seems that this bot is only modestly profitable -- most of its transactions yield very small amounts of profit.

------
However, I want to highlight another way in which this is true:

We may see that, once a change like EIP-2930 is introduced, developers will begin to architect contracts with parallelism in mind to enable even more efficient MEV extraction than what e.g. backtests may suggest!
------
Because realistically Jump will need to accept bundles from external searchers.

Eventually a large % of validator revenue will come from MEV, and only in a competitive environment can the most profitable bundles be found.

Teams like 
@jito_labs
 are already working on this.
------
While Jump with 20% of the stake is guaranteed 20% of the blocks...how can the two compete when one entity gets 400x more blockspace? 

I do think bigger stakers getting more blockspace is logical, but it's ironic given how bitterly some complained against the eth fee market

I'm inclined to believe this effect may negatively impact DAOs that partake in such programs, but would like to be more informed.
------
Treasury mgmt will be a big sub theme in 2022. I used to question lightly on the demand for fixed rate / structured products but they are absolutely needed as the DAOs getting more sophisticated with their long term treasury mgmt. 

Hv some names in mind but shout out yours?! ;)
------
Is there any reason why Uniswap v3 doesn't let each LP choose any fee they want rather than have set tiers (.05%, .30%, etc) that fracture liquidity?

Is it because it's computationally expensive to perform a swap over the aggregated liquidity?
------
Prediction:

The big Solana derivatives trading accounts will shift towards having multiple wallets + off-chain collateral management system

This enables them to optimize for parallel execution on cross margin systems such as 
@01_exchange
 and 
@mangomarkets

Solana fee market discussions are starting to materialize by @aeyakovenko @buffalu__

Interesting note: Because Solana locks per account (as opposed to globally, like the EVM), there will likely be "micro fee markets" per account rather than a global one.

Solana Alpha Leak

Don't fully rent exempt unless needed!

Compute is cheap, but storage is not - new Serum pairs cost $200+!

Ex:
Options - most state only needed until expiry
Auctions - most state only needed until close
Chess - timed games only last minutes/hours
------
Note - to do this in 
@anchorlang
 you need to use rent_exempt = skip in the constraint list
------
This is why I keep saying:

"Automated Basis Trade" vaults will be the real sustainable yield structured products
------
- "sustainable alpha"
------
It is interesting how parallelization designs like EIP-2930 and Solana Sealevel (which are inherently coarse-grained) can lead to dev/smart contract programming paradigm shift (which provide free? oracles for relatively fine-grained state witnesses) 1/4
------
However, I want to highlight another way in which this is true:

We may see that, once a change like EIP-2930 is introduced, developers will begin to architect contracts with parallelism in mind to enable even more efficient MEV extraction than what e.g. backtests may suggest!
------
Because realistically Jump will need to accept bundles from external searchers.

Eventually a large % of validator revenue will come from MEV, and only in a competitive environment can the most profitable bundles be found.

Teams like 
@jito_labs
 are already working on this.
------
While Jump with 20% of the stake is guaranteed 20% of the blocks...how can the two compete when one entity gets 400x more blockspace? 

I do think bigger stakers getting more blockspace is logical, but it's ironic given how bitterly some complained against the eth fee market

This gives a nice heuristic for calculating transaction ordering:

If two bundles touch the same storage location, they (likely) clash.

Solana dev alpha leak:

contracts can often be optimized using "account clustering" techniques.

example:
before: 1 oracle PDA per mint, derived using mint key
after: 1 oracle PDA per N mints, derived using an incrementing index
------
note: you don't even have to store the index!

oracle PDA init instruction accepts:
index param, i
initialized oracle PDA for index i
(if i!=0) existing oracle PDA for index i-1

this ensures that oracle PDAs for indices [0, i) exist and that oracle PDA for index i does not exist

on protocols like mim/dai, only the stablecoin minters can redeem it for anything (their collateral)

but what if vaults were nfts that could be traded?

e.g. i mint $1 mim from $2 eth, then i can keep the mim and trade my vault (which is long $2 eth short $1 mim) to someone else

FTX just wants to know which to prioritize

These are both L1 integrations, which require setting up nodes, infrastructure, on-chain analysis software, internal and external audits, etc.

Learn from the Wormhole hack - any slight error can potentially ruin the exchange https://twitter.com/cobie/status/1489777086709518337…
------
Unfortunately, this is not true; there are already backroom deals in which searchers pay validators for privileged access to their blockspace.
------
There is also no fees market, so there is no way for MEV searchers to incentivize validators to order Txs based on fees 'yet'!

Wormhole Hack Thread  Additional Details + Prevention

Others have already described how it happened, going to talk about how it could have been prevented and note additional details that haven't been covered.
------
Also, this PR contains a *ton* of changes, upgrading various parts of the codebase to newer versions.

The devs should have considered if these upgrades patch vulnerabilities that are currently exploitable, but given the magnitude of changes, I can see why it would be difficult.
------
Overall, I wouldn't be too harsh on the Wormhole team here. Ultimately they made everyone whole and paid quite a hefty price to do so.

These things are always hard.
------
There are two major bridged ETH tokens on Solana:

- soETH (Sollet ETH)  ~$1.3B
- wETH / whETH (Wormhole ETH) ~$0.3B

Only the Wormhole variant is affected, which means that programs like 
@MangoMarkets
 and 
@JetProtocol
 are completely safe as they use Sollet ETH. https://twitter.com/tony_intern/status/1488993537836290048…

Solana dev alpha leak:

contracts can often be optimized using "account clustering" techniques.

example:
before: 1 oracle PDA per mint, derived using mint key
after: 1 oracle PDA per N mints, derived using an incrementing index
------
note: you don't even have to store the index!

oracle PDA init instruction accepts:
index param, i
initialized oracle PDA for index i
(if i!=0) existing oracle PDA for index i-1

this ensures that oracle PDAs for indices [0, i) exist and that oracle PDA for index i does not exist

on protocols like mim/dai, only the stablecoin minters can redeem it for anything (their collateral)

but what if vaults were nfts that could be traded?

Thanks for the work you do.

it's pretty crazy how much room is still there to optimize the solana validator code. makes me think that 1M tps is definitely within reach in the future.
------
I see a bunch of low hanging fruit i.e. things that can be fixed in weeks not years. 

So devs (myself included) get upset or joke about this but underlying reality is nuanced. 

(btw Mango dev calls and Solana discord are good places to get that nuance)

Curve liquidity isn't for trading, it's for peg stability. The decrease in volume against uni v3 doesn't affect Curve's core value prop

Remember, there is nothing inherent about the design of "mint one X stablecoin for $2 of collateral" that says that X needs to trade at $1.
------
Sorry, but Curve wars are dumb.

1) These features should've been built into Curve natively from the start. A product miss has spawned this entire industry.

2) This glosses over Curve losing stablecoin swap mkt share. You're bikeshedding while the shed is burning down behind you

This is why I keep saying:

"Automated Basis Trade" vaults will be the real sustainable yield structured products

It is interesting how parallelization designs like EIP-2930 and Solana Sealevel (which are inherently coarse-grained) can lead to dev/smart contract programming paradigm shift (which provide free? oracles for relatively fine-grained state witnesses) 1/4
------
However, I want to highlight another way in which this is true:

We may see that, once a change like EIP-2930 is introduced, developers will begin to architect contracts with parallelism in mind to enable even more efficient MEV extraction than what e.g. backtests may suggest!
------
Because realistically Jump will need to accept bundles from external searchers.

Eventually a large % of validator revenue will come from MEV, and only in a competitive environment can the most profitable bundles be found.

Teams like 
@jito_labs
 are already working on this.
------
While Jump with 20% of the stake is guaranteed 20% of the blocks...how can the two compete when one entity gets 400x more blockspace? 

I do think bigger stakers getting more blockspace is logical, but it's ironic given how bitterly some complained against the eth fee market

Just gonna say it again. 

@etherscan is a monsters of a company. 

So important to the entire ecosystem. 

Thanks for the work you do.
------
it's pretty crazy how much room is still there to optimize the solana validator code. makes me think that 1M tps is definitely within reach in the future.
------
I see a bunch of low hanging fruit i.e. things that can be fixed in weeks not years. 

So devs (myself included) get upset or joke about this but underlying reality is nuanced. 

(btw Mango dev calls and Solana discord are good places to get that nuance)
------
mango perps are already 5bps taker and 4bps maker rebate, bringing in the fee spread gets you to 1bps taker (makers can widen by 4bps to simulate the rebate)
------
Dydx fees now competitive with mango. Mango DAO please do something twitter.com/AntonioMJulian…

100% agree, a few months ago I would have said that on chain privacy is nice but still niche

my view has shifted in the last month or so though and I strongly believe that privacy is a necessity for any blockchain that wants real world adoption
------
i don't understand the "mass surveillance is bad, but mass financial surveillance is not" people. do you not realize that literally everything anyone does requires usage of the financial system and therefore mass financial surveillance is mass surveillance
------
disagree, I think there needs to be room for others to try things that the ethereum community may not believe will work.

and yes, part of that is marketing rather than any sort of technological innovations.
------
I feel the same about L1s. The majority of them focus on community development to pump the token, then wait for Ethereum to solve the outstanding problems (PBS, protocol MEV, stateless verification, history+state expiry, wallet UX, etc). twitter.com/lightclients/s…

while txs under a dollar are a great and hats off to the optimism team, i feel like txs need to be under 1 cent to enable 90% of real world applications to move on chain

Curve liquidity isn't for trading, it's for peg stability. The decrease in volume against uni v3 doesn't affect Curve's core value prop

Remember, there is nothing inherent about the design of "mint one X stablecoin for $2 of collateral" that says that X needs to trade at $1.

Sorry, but Curve wars are dumb.

1) These features should've been built into Curve natively from the start. A product miss has spawned this entire industry.

2) This glosses over Curve losing stablecoin swap mkt share. You're bikeshedding while the shed is burning down behind you

Curve liquidity isn't for trading, it's for peg stability. The decrease in volume against uni v3 doesn't affect Curve's core value prop

Sorry, but Curve wars are dumb.

1) These features should've been built into Curve natively from the start. A product miss has spawned this entire industry.

2) This glosses over Curve losing stablecoin swap mkt share. You're bikeshedding while the shed is burning down behind you

Just gonna say it again. 

@etherscan is a monsters of a company. 

So important to the entire ecosystem. 

Thanks for the work you do.
------
it's pretty crazy how much room is still there to optimize the solana validator code. makes me think that 1M tps is definitely within reach in the future.
------
I see a bunch of low hanging fruit i.e. things that can be fixed in weeks not years. 

So devs (myself included) get upset or joke about this but underlying reality is nuanced. 

(btw Mango dev calls and Solana discord are good places to get that nuance)
------
mango perps are already 5bps taker and 4bps maker rebate, bringing in the fee spread gets you to 1bps taker (makers can widen by 4bps to simulate the rebate)

Just gonna say it again. 

@etherscan is a monsters of a company. 

So important to the entire ecosystem. 

Thanks for the work you do.
------
it's pretty crazy how much room is still there to optimize the solana validator code. makes me think that 1M tps is definitely within reach in the future.
------
I see a bunch of low hanging fruit i.e. things that can be fixed in weeks not years. 

So devs (myself included) get upset or joke about this but underlying reality is nuanced. 

(btw Mango dev calls and Solana discord are good places to get that nuance)
------
mango perps are already 5bps taker and 4bps maker rebate, bringing in the fee spread gets you to 1bps taker (makers can widen by 4bps to simulate the rebate)
------
Dydx fees now competitive with mango. Mango DAO please do something twitter.com/AntonioMJulian…

100% agree, a few months ago I would have said that on chain privacy is nice but still niche

my view has shifted in the last month or so though and I strongly believe that privacy is a necessity for any blockchain that wants real world adoption
------
i don't understand the "mass surveillance is bad, but mass financial surveillance is not" people. do you not realize that literally everything anyone does requires usage of the financial system and therefore mass financial surveillance is mass surveillance
------
disagree, I think there needs to be room for others to try things that the ethereum community may not believe will work.

and yes, part of that is marketing rather than any sort of technological innovations.

I feel the same about L1s. The majority of them focus on community development to pump the token, then wait for Ethereum to solve the outstanding problems (PBS, protocol MEV, stateless verification, history+state expiry, wallet UX, etc). twitter.com/lightclients/s…

while txs under a dollar are a great and hats off to the optimism team, i feel like txs need to be under 1 cent to enable 90% of real world applications to move on chain

Curve liquidity isn't for trading, it's for peg stability. The decrease in volume against uni v3 doesn't affect Curve's core value prop

Remember, there is nothing inherent about the design of "mint one X stablecoin for $2 of collateral" that says that X needs to trade at $1.

Sorry, but Curve wars are dumb.

1) These features should've been built into Curve natively from the start. A product miss has spawned this entire industry.

2) This glosses over Curve losing stablecoin swap mkt share. You're bikeshedding while the shed is burning down behind you

Curve liquidity isn't for trading, it's for peg stability. The decrease in volume against uni v3 doesn't affect Curve's core value prop

Sorry, but Curve wars are dumb.

1) These features should've been built into Curve natively from the start. A product miss has spawned this entire industry.

2) This glosses over Curve losing stablecoin swap mkt share. You're bikeshedding while the shed is burning down behind you

Just gonna say it again. 

@etherscan is a monsters of a company. 

So important to the entire ecosystem. 

Thanks for the work you do.
------
it's pretty crazy how much room is still there to optimize the solana validator code. makes me think that 1M tps is definitely within reach in the future.
------
I see a bunch of low hanging fruit i.e. things that can be fixed in weeks not years. 

So devs (myself included) get upset or joke about this but underlying reality is nuanced. 

(btw Mango dev calls and Solana discord are good places to get that nuance)
------
mango perps are already 5bps taker and 4bps maker rebate, bringing in the fee spread gets you to 1bps taker (makers can widen by 4bps to simulate the rebate)

Just gonna say it again. 

@etherscan is a monsters of a company. 

So important to the entire ecosystem. 

Thanks for the work you do.
------
it's pretty crazy how much room is still there to optimize the solana validator code. makes me think that 1M tps is definitely within reach in the future.
------
I see a bunch of low hanging fruit i.e. things that can be fixed in weeks not years. 

So devs (myself included) get upset or joke about this but underlying reality is nuanced. 

(btw Mango dev calls and Solana discord are good places to get that nuance)
------
mango perps are already 5bps taker and 4bps maker rebate, bringing in the fee spread gets you to 1bps taker (makers can widen by 4bps to simulate the rebate)
------
Dydx fees now competitive with mango. Mango DAO please do something twitter.com/AntonioMJulian…

100% agree, a few months ago I would have said that on chain privacy is nice but still niche

my view has shifted in the last month or so though and I strongly believe that privacy is a necessity for any blockchain that wants real world adoption
------
i don't understand the "mass surveillance is bad, but mass financial surveillance is not" people. do you not realize that literally everything anyone does requires usage of the financial system and therefore mass financial surveillance is mass surveillance
------
disagree, I think there needs to be room for others to try things that the ethereum community may not believe will work.

and yes, part of that is marketing rather than any sort of technological innovations.

I feel the same about L1s. The majority of them focus on community development to pump the token, then wait for Ethereum to solve the outstanding problems (PBS, protocol MEV, stateless verification, history+state expiry, wallet UX, etc). twitter.com/lightclients/s…

while txs under a dollar are a great and hats off to the optimism team, i feel like txs need to be under 1 cent to enable 90% of real world applications to move on chain

Curve liquidity isn't for trading, it's for peg stability. The decrease in volume against uni v3 doesn't affect Curve's core value prop

Remember, there is nothing inherent about the design of "mint one X stablecoin for $2 of collateral" that says that X needs to trade at $1.

Sorry, but Curve wars are dumb.

1) These features should've been built into Curve natively from the start. A product miss has spawned this entire industry.

2) This glosses over Curve losing stablecoin swap mkt share. You're bikeshedding while the shed is burning down behind you

Curve liquidity isn't for trading, it's for peg stability. The decrease in volume against uni v3 doesn't affect Curve's core value prop

Sorry, but Curve wars are dumb.

1) These features should've been built into Curve natively from the start. A product miss has spawned this entire industry.

2) This glosses over Curve losing stablecoin swap mkt share. You're bikeshedding while the shed is burning down behind you

Just gonna say it again. 

@etherscan is a monsters of a company. 

So important to the entire ecosystem. 

Thanks for the work you do.
------
it's pretty crazy how much room is still there to optimize the solana validator code. makes me think that 1M tps is definitely within reach in the future.
------
I see a bunch of low hanging fruit i.e. things that can be fixed in weeks not years. 

So devs (myself included) get upset or joke about this but underlying reality is nuanced. 

(btw Mango dev calls and Solana discord are good places to get that nuance)
------
mango perps are already 5bps taker and 4bps maker rebate, bringing in the fee spread gets you to 1bps taker (makers can widen by 4bps to simulate the rebate)

Just gonna say it again. 

@etherscan is a monsters of a company. 

So important to the entire ecosystem. 

Thanks for the work you do.
------
it's pretty crazy how much room is still there to optimize the solana validator code. makes me think that 1M tps is definitely within reach in the future.
------
I see a bunch of low hanging fruit i.e. things that can be fixed in weeks not years. 

So devs (myself included) get upset or joke about this but underlying reality is nuanced. 

(btw Mango dev calls and Solana discord are good places to get that nuance)
------
mango perps are already 5bps taker and 4bps maker rebate, bringing in the fee spread gets you to 1bps taker (makers can widen by 4bps to simulate the rebate)
------
Dydx fees now competitive with mango. Mango DAO please do something twitter.com/AntonioMJulian…

100% agree, a few months ago I would have said that on chain privacy is nice but still niche

my view has shifted in the last month or so though and I strongly believe that privacy is a necessity for any blockchain that wants real world adoption
------
i don't understand the "mass surveillance is bad, but mass financial surveillance is not" people. do you not realize that literally everything anyone does requires usage of the financial system and therefore mass financial surveillance is mass surveillance
------
disagree, I think there needs to be room for others to try things that the ethereum community may not believe will work.

and yes, part of that is marketing rather than any sort of technological innovations.

I feel the same about L1s. The majority of them focus on community development to pump the token, then wait for Ethereum to solve the outstanding problems (PBS, protocol MEV, stateless verification, history+state expiry, wallet UX, etc). twitter.com/lightclients/s…

while txs under a dollar are a great and hats off to the optimism team, i feel like txs need to be under 1 cent to enable 90% of real world applications to move on chain

Curve liquidity isn't for trading, it's for peg stability. The decrease in volume against uni v3 doesn't affect Curve's core value prop

Remember, there is nothing inherent about the design of "mint one X stablecoin for $2 of collateral" that says that X needs to trade at $1.

Sorry, but Curve wars are dumb.

1) These features should've been built into Curve natively from the start. A product miss has spawned this entire industry.

2) This glosses over Curve losing stablecoin swap mkt share. You're bikeshedding while the shed is burning down behind you

Curve liquidity isn't for trading, it's for peg stability. The decrease in volume against uni v3 doesn't affect Curve's core value prop

Sorry, but Curve wars are dumb.

1) These features should've been built into Curve natively from the start. A product miss has spawned this entire industry.

2) This glosses over Curve losing stablecoin swap mkt share. You're bikeshedding while the shed is burning down behind you

Just gonna say it again. 

@etherscan is a monsters of a company. 

So important to the entire ecosystem. 

Thanks for the work you do.
------
it's pretty crazy how much room is still there to optimize the solana validator code. makes me think that 1M tps is definitely within reach in the future.
------
I see a bunch of low hanging fruit i.e. things that can be fixed in weeks not years. 

So devs (myself included) get upset or joke about this but underlying reality is nuanced. 

(btw Mango dev calls and Solana discord are good places to get that nuance)
------
mango perps are already 5bps taker and 4bps maker rebate, bringing in the fee spread gets you to 1bps taker (makers can widen by 4bps to simulate the rebate)

Just gonna say it again. 

@etherscan is a monsters of a company. 

So important to the entire ecosystem. 

Thanks for the work you do.
------
it's pretty crazy how much room is still there to optimize the solana validator code. makes me think that 1M tps is definitely within reach in the future.
------
I see a bunch of low hanging fruit i.e. things that can be fixed in weeks not years. 

So devs (myself included) get upset or joke about this but underlying reality is nuanced. 

(btw Mango dev calls and Solana discord are good places to get that nuance)
------
mango perps are already 5bps taker and 4bps maker rebate, bringing in the fee spread gets you to 1bps taker (makers can widen by 4bps to simulate the rebate)
------
Dydx fees now competitive with mango. Mango DAO please do something twitter.com/AntonioMJulian…

100% agree, a few months ago I would have said that on chain privacy is nice but still niche

my view has shifted in the last month or so though and I strongly believe that privacy is a necessity for any blockchain that wants real world adoption
------
i don't understand the "mass surveillance is bad, but mass financial surveillance is not" people. do you not realize that literally everything anyone does requires usage of the financial system and therefore mass financial surveillance is mass surveillance
------
disagree, I think there needs to be room for others to try things that the ethereum community may not believe will work.

and yes, part of that is marketing rather than any sort of technological innovations.

I feel the same about L1s. The majority of them focus on community development to pump the token, then wait for Ethereum to solve the outstanding problems (PBS, protocol MEV, stateless verification, history+state expiry, wallet UX, etc). twitter.com/lightclients/s…

while txs under a dollar are a great and hats off to the optimism team, i feel like txs need to be under 1 cent to enable 90% of real world applications to move on chain

Curve liquidity isn't for trading, it's for peg stability. The decrease in volume against uni v3 doesn't affect Curve's core value prop

Remember, there is nothing inherent about the design of "mint one X stablecoin for $2 of collateral" that says that X needs to trade at $1.

Sorry, but Curve wars are dumb.

1) These features should've been built into Curve natively from the start. A product miss has spawned this entire industry.

2) This glosses over Curve losing stablecoin swap mkt share. You're bikeshedding while the shed is burning down behind you

Curve liquidity isn't for trading, it's for peg stability. The decrease in volume against uni v3 doesn't affect Curve's core value prop

Sorry, but Curve wars are dumb.

1) These features should've been built into Curve natively from the start. A product miss has spawned this entire industry.

2) This glosses over Curve losing stablecoin swap mkt share. You're bikeshedding while the shed is burning down behind you

Just gonna say it again. 

@etherscan is a monsters of a company. 

So important to the entire ecosystem. 

Thanks for the work you do.
------
it's pretty crazy how much room is still there to optimize the solana validator code. makes me think that 1M tps is definitely within reach in the future.
------
I see a bunch of low hanging fruit i.e. things that can be fixed in weeks not years. 

So devs (myself included) get upset or joke about this but underlying reality is nuanced. 

(btw Mango dev calls and Solana discord are good places to get that nuance)
------
mango perps are already 5bps taker and 4bps maker rebate, bringing in the fee spread gets you to 1bps taker (makers can widen by 4bps to simulate the rebate)

Just gonna say it again. 

@etherscan is a monsters of a company. 

So important to the entire ecosystem. 

Thanks for the work you do.
------
it's pretty crazy how much room is still there to optimize the solana validator code. makes me think that 1M tps is definitely within reach in the future.
------
I see a bunch of low hanging fruit i.e. things that can be fixed in weeks not years. 

So devs (myself included) get upset or joke about this but underlying reality is nuanced. 

(btw Mango dev calls and Solana discord are good places to get that nuance)
------
mango perps are already 5bps taker and 4bps maker rebate, bringing in the fee spread gets you to 1bps taker (makers can widen by 4bps to simulate the rebate)
------
Dydx fees now competitive with mango. Mango DAO please do something twitter.com/AntonioMJulian…

100% agree, a few months ago I would have said that on chain privacy is nice but still niche

my view has shifted in the last month or so though and I strongly believe that privacy is a necessity for any blockchain that wants real world adoption
------
i don't understand the "mass surveillance is bad, but mass financial surveillance is not" people. do you not realize that literally everything anyone does requires usage of the financial system and therefore mass financial surveillance is mass surveillance
------
disagree, I think there needs to be room for others to try things that the ethereum community may not believe will work.

and yes, part of that is marketing rather than any sort of technological innovations.

I feel the same about L1s. The majority of them focus on community development to pump the token, then wait for Ethereum to solve the outstanding problems (PBS, protocol MEV, stateless verification, history+state expiry, wallet UX, etc). twitter.com/lightclients/s…

while txs under a dollar are a great and hats off to the optimism team, i feel like txs need to be under 1 cent to enable 90% of real world applications to move on chain

Curve liquidity isn't for trading, it's for peg stability. The decrease in volume against uni v3 doesn't affect Curve's core value prop

Remember, there is nothing inherent about the design of "mint one X stablecoin for $2 of collateral" that says that X needs to trade at $1.

Sorry, but Curve wars are dumb.

1) These features should've been built into Curve natively from the start. A product miss has spawned this entire industry.

2) This glosses over Curve losing stablecoin swap mkt share. You're bikeshedding while the shed is burning down behind you

Curve liquidity isn't for trading, it's for peg stability. The decrease in volume against uni v3 doesn't affect Curve's core value prop

Sorry, but Curve wars are dumb.

1) These features should've been built into Curve natively from the start. A product miss has spawned this entire industry.

2) This glosses over Curve losing stablecoin swap mkt share. You're bikeshedding while the shed is burning down behind you

Just gonna say it again. 

@etherscan is a monsters of a company. 

So important to the entire ecosystem. 

Thanks for the work you do.
------
it's pretty crazy how much room is still there to optimize the solana validator code. makes me think that 1M tps is definitely within reach in the future.
------
I see a bunch of low hanging fruit i.e. things that can be fixed in weeks not years. 

So devs (myself included) get upset or joke about this but underlying reality is nuanced. 

(btw Mango dev calls and Solana discord are good places to get that nuance)
------
mango perps are already 5bps taker and 4bps maker rebate, bringing in the fee spread gets you to 1bps taker (makers can widen by 4bps to simulate the rebate)

Just gonna say it again. 

@etherscan is a monsters of a company. 

So important to the entire ecosystem. 

Thanks for the work you do.
------
it's pretty crazy how much room is still there to optimize the solana validator code. makes me think that 1M tps is definitely within reach in the future.
------
I see a bunch of low hanging fruit i.e. things that can be fixed in weeks not years. 

So devs (myself included) get upset or joke about this but underlying reality is nuanced. 

(btw Mango dev calls and Solana discord are good places to get that nuance)
------
mango perps are already 5bps taker and 4bps maker rebate, bringing in the fee spread gets you to 1bps taker (makers can widen by 4bps to simulate the rebate)
------
Dydx fees now competitive with mango. Mango DAO please do something twitter.com/AntonioMJulian…

100% agree, a few months ago I would have said that on chain privacy is nice but still niche

my view has shifted in the last month or so though and I strongly believe that privacy is a necessity for any blockchain that wants real world adoption
------
i don't understand the "mass surveillance is bad, but mass financial surveillance is not" people. do you not realize that literally everything anyone does requires usage of the financial system and therefore mass financial surveillance is mass surveillance
------
disagree, I think there needs to be room for others to try things that the ethereum community may not believe will work.

and yes, part of that is marketing rather than any sort of technological innovations.

I feel the same about L1s. The majority of them focus on community development to pump the token, then wait for Ethereum to solve the outstanding problems (PBS, protocol MEV, stateless verification, history+state expiry, wallet UX, etc). twitter.com/lightclients/s…

while txs under a dollar are a great and hats off to the optimism team, i feel like txs need to be under 1 cent to enable 90% of real world applications to move on chain

Curve liquidity isn't for trading, it's for peg stability. The decrease in volume against uni v3 doesn't affect Curve's core value prop

Remember, there is nothing inherent about the design of "mint one X stablecoin for $2 of collateral" that says that X needs to trade at $1.

Sorry, but Curve wars are dumb.

1) These features should've been built into Curve natively from the start. A product miss has spawned this entire industry.

2) This glosses over Curve losing stablecoin swap mkt share. You're bikeshedding while the shed is burning down behind you

Curve liquidity isn't for trading, it's for peg stability. The decrease in volume against uni v3 doesn't affect Curve's core value prop

Sorry, but Curve wars are dumb.

1) These features should've been built into Curve natively from the start. A product miss has spawned this entire industry.

2) This glosses over Curve losing stablecoin swap mkt share. You're bikeshedding while the shed is burning down behind you

Just gonna say it again. 

@etherscan is a monsters of a company. 

So important to the entire ecosystem. 

Thanks for the work you do.
------
it's pretty crazy how much room is still there to optimize the solana validator code. makes me think that 1M tps is definitely within reach in the future.
------
I see a bunch of low hanging fruit i.e. things that can be fixed in weeks not years. 

So devs (myself included) get upset or joke about this but underlying reality is nuanced. 

(btw Mango dev calls and Solana discord are good places to get that nuance)
------
mango perps are already 5bps taker and 4bps maker rebate, bringing in the fee spread gets you to 1bps taker (makers can widen by 4bps to simulate the rebate)

Just gonna say it again. 

@etherscan is a monsters of a company. 

So important to the entire ecosystem. 

Thanks for the work you do.
------
it's pretty crazy how much room is still there to optimize the solana validator code. makes me think that 1M tps is definitely within reach in the future.
------
I see a bunch of low hanging fruit i.e. things that can be fixed in weeks not years. 

So devs (myself included) get upset or joke about this but underlying reality is nuanced. 

(btw Mango dev calls and Solana discord are good places to get that nuance)
------
mango perps are already 5bps taker and 4bps maker rebate, bringing in the fee spread gets you to 1bps taker (makers can widen by 4bps to simulate the rebate)
------
Dydx fees now competitive with mango. Mango DAO please do something twitter.com/AntonioMJulian…

100% agree, a few months ago I would have said that on chain privacy is nice but still niche

my view has shifted in the last month or so though and I strongly believe that privacy is a necessity for any blockchain that wants real world adoption
------
i don't understand the "mass surveillance is bad, but mass financial surveillance is not" people. do you not realize that literally everything anyone does requires usage of the financial system and therefore mass financial surveillance is mass surveillance
------
disagree, I think there needs to be room for others to try things that the ethereum community may not believe will work.

and yes, part of that is marketing rather than any sort of technological innovations.

I feel the same about L1s. The majority of them focus on community development to pump the token, then wait for Ethereum to solve the outstanding problems (PBS, protocol MEV, stateless verification, history+state expiry, wallet UX, etc). twitter.com/lightclients/s…

while txs under a dollar are a great and hats off to the optimism team, i feel like txs need to be under 1 cent to enable 90% of real world applications to move on chain

Curve liquidity isn't for trading, it's for peg stability. The decrease in volume against uni v3 doesn't affect Curve's core value prop

Remember, there is nothing inherent about the design of "mint one X stablecoin for $2 of collateral" that says that X needs to trade at $1.

Sorry, but Curve wars are dumb.

1) These features should've been built into Curve natively from the start. A product miss has spawned this entire industry.

2) This glosses over Curve losing stablecoin swap mkt share. You're bikeshedding while the shed is burning down behind you

Curve liquidity isn't for trading, it's for peg stability. The decrease in volume against uni v3 doesn't affect Curve's core value prop

Sorry, but Curve wars are dumb.

1) These features should've been built into Curve natively from the start. A product miss has spawned this entire industry.

2) This glosses over Curve losing stablecoin swap mkt share. You're bikeshedding while the shed is burning down behind you

Just gonna say it again. 

@etherscan is a monsters of a company. 

So important to the entire ecosystem. 

Thanks for the work you do.
------
it's pretty crazy how much room is still there to optimize the solana validator code. makes me think that 1M tps is definitely within reach in the future.
------
I see a bunch of low hanging fruit i.e. things that can be fixed in weeks not years. 

So devs (myself included) get upset or joke about this but underlying reality is nuanced. 

(btw Mango dev calls and Solana discord are good places to get that nuance)
------
mango perps are already 5bps taker and 4bps maker rebate, bringing in the fee spread gets you to 1bps taker (makers can widen by 4bps to simulate the rebate)

Just gonna say it again. 

@etherscan is a monsters of a company. 

So important to the entire ecosystem. 

Thanks for the work you do.
------
it's pretty crazy how much room is still there to optimize the solana validator code. makes me think that 1M tps is definitely within reach in the future.
------
I see a bunch of low hanging fruit i.e. things that can be fixed in weeks not years. 

So devs (myself included) get upset or joke about this but underlying reality is nuanced. 

(btw Mango dev calls and Solana discord are good places to get that nuance)
------
mango perps are already 5bps taker and 4bps maker rebate, bringing in the fee spread gets you to 1bps taker (makers can widen by 4bps to simulate the rebate)
------
Dydx fees now competitive with mango. Mango DAO please do something twitter.com/AntonioMJulian…

100% agree, a few months ago I would have said that on chain privacy is nice but still niche

my view has shifted in the last month or so though and I strongly believe that privacy is a necessity for any blockchain that wants real world adoption
------
i don't understand the "mass surveillance is bad, but mass financial surveillance is not" people. do you not realize that literally everything anyone does requires usage of the financial system and therefore mass financial surveillance is mass surveillance
------
disagree, I think there needs to be room for others to try things that the ethereum community may not believe will work.

and yes, part of that is marketing rather than any sort of technological innovations.

I feel the same about L1s. The majority of them focus on community development to pump the token, then wait for Ethereum to solve the outstanding problems (PBS, protocol MEV, stateless verification, history+state expiry, wallet UX, etc). twitter.com/lightclients/s…

while txs under a dollar are a great and hats off to the optimism team, i feel like txs need to be under 1 cent to enable 90% of real world applications to move on chain

Curve liquidity isn't for trading, it's for peg stability. The decrease in volume against uni v3 doesn't affect Curve's core value prop

Remember, there is nothing inherent about the design of "mint one X stablecoin for $2 of collateral" that says that X needs to trade at $1.

Sorry, but Curve wars are dumb.

1) These features should've been built into Curve natively from the start. A product miss has spawned this entire industry.

2) This glosses over Curve losing stablecoin swap mkt share. You're bikeshedding while the shed is burning down behind you

Curve liquidity isn't for trading, it's for peg stability. The decrease in volume against uni v3 doesn't affect Curve's core value prop

Sorry, but Curve wars are dumb.

1) These features should've been built into Curve natively from the start. A product miss has spawned this entire industry.

2) This glosses over Curve losing stablecoin swap mkt share. You're bikeshedding while the shed is burning down behind you

Just gonna say it again. 

@etherscan is a monsters of a company. 

So important to the entire ecosystem. 

Thanks for the work you do.
------
it's pretty crazy how much room is still there to optimize the solana validator code. makes me think that 1M tps is definitely within reach in the future.
------
I see a bunch of low hanging fruit i.e. things that can be fixed in weeks not years. 

So devs (myself included) get upset or joke about this but underlying reality is nuanced. 

(btw Mango dev calls and Solana discord are good places to get that nuance)
------
mango perps are already 5bps taker and 4bps maker rebate, bringing in the fee spread gets you to 1bps taker (makers can widen by 4bps to simulate the rebate)

Just gonna say it again. 

@etherscan is a monsters of a company. 

So important to the entire ecosystem. 

Thanks for the work you do.
------
it's pretty crazy how much room is still there to optimize the solana validator code. makes me think that 1M tps is definitely within reach in the future.
------
I see a bunch of low hanging fruit i.e. things that can be fixed in weeks not years. 

So devs (myself included) get upset or joke about this but underlying reality is nuanced. 

(btw Mango dev calls and Solana discord are good places to get that nuance)
------
mango perps are already 5bps taker and 4bps maker rebate, bringing in the fee spread gets you to 1bps taker (makers can widen by 4bps to simulate the rebate)
------
Dydx fees now competitive with mango. Mango DAO please do something twitter.com/AntonioMJulian…

100% agree, a few months ago I would have said that on chain privacy is nice but still niche

my view has shifted in the last month or so though and I strongly believe that privacy is a necessity for any blockchain that wants real world adoption
------
i don't understand the "mass surveillance is bad, but mass financial surveillance is not" people. do you not realize that literally everything anyone does requires usage of the financial system and therefore mass financial surveillance is mass surveillance
------
disagree, I think there needs to be room for others to try things that the ethereum community may not believe will work.

and yes, part of that is marketing rather than any sort of technological innovations.

I feel the same about L1s. The majority of them focus on community development to pump the token, then wait for Ethereum to solve the outstanding problems (PBS, protocol MEV, stateless verification, history+state expiry, wallet UX, etc). twitter.com/lightclients/s…

while txs under a dollar are a great and hats off to the optimism team, i feel like txs need to be under 1 cent to enable 90% of real world applications to move on chain

Curve liquidity isn't for trading, it's for peg stability. The decrease in volume against uni v3 doesn't affect Curve's core value prop

Remember, there is nothing inherent about the design of "mint one X stablecoin for $2 of collateral" that says that X needs to trade at $1.

Sorry, but Curve wars are dumb.

1) These features should've been built into Curve natively from the start. A product miss has spawned this entire industry.

2) This glosses over Curve losing stablecoin swap mkt share. You're bikeshedding while the shed is burning down behind you

Curve liquidity isn't for trading, it's for peg stability. The decrease in volume against uni v3 doesn't affect Curve's core value prop

Sorry, but Curve wars are dumb.

1) These features should've been built into Curve natively from the start. A product miss has spawned this entire industry.

2) This glosses over Curve losing stablecoin swap mkt share. You're bikeshedding while the shed is burning down behind you

Just gonna say it again. 

@etherscan is a monsters of a company. 

So important to the entire ecosystem. 

Thanks for the work you do.
------
it's pretty crazy how much room is still there to optimize the solana validator code. makes me think that 1M tps is definitely within reach in the future.
------
I see a bunch of low hanging fruit i.e. things that can be fixed in weeks not years. 

So devs (myself included) get upset or joke about this but underlying reality is nuanced. 

(btw Mango dev calls and Solana discord are good places to get that nuance)
------
mango perps are already 5bps taker and 4bps maker rebate, bringing in the fee spread gets you to 1bps taker (makers can widen by 4bps to simulate the rebate)

Just gonna say it again. 

@etherscan is a monsters of a company. 

So important to the entire ecosystem. 

Thanks for the work you do.
------
it's pretty crazy how much room is still there to optimize the solana validator code. makes me think that 1M tps is definitely within reach in the future.
------
I see a bunch of low hanging fruit i.e. things that can be fixed in weeks not years. 

So devs (myself included) get upset or joke about this but underlying reality is nuanced. 

(btw Mango dev calls and Solana discord are good places to get that nuance)
------
mango perps are already 5bps taker and 4bps maker rebate, bringing in the fee spread gets you to 1bps taker (makers can widen by 4bps to simulate the rebate)
------
Dydx fees now competitive with mango. Mango DAO please do something twitter.com/AntonioMJulian…

100% agree, a few months ago I would have said that on chain privacy is nice but still niche

my view has shifted in the last month or so though and I strongly believe that privacy is a necessity for any blockchain that wants real world adoption
------
i don't understand the "mass surveillance is bad, but mass financial surveillance is not" people. do you not realize that literally everything anyone does requires usage of the financial system and therefore mass financial surveillance is mass surveillance
------
disagree, I think there needs to be room for others to try things that the ethereum community may not believe will work.

and yes, part of that is marketing rather than any sort of technological innovations.

I feel the same about L1s. The majority of them focus on community development to pump the token, then wait for Ethereum to solve the outstanding problems (PBS, protocol MEV, stateless verification, history+state expiry, wallet UX, etc). twitter.com/lightclients/s…

while txs under a dollar are a great and hats off to the optimism team, i feel like txs need to be under 1 cent to enable 90% of real world applications to move on chain

Curve liquidity isn't for trading, it's for peg stability. The decrease in volume against uni v3 doesn't affect Curve's core value prop

Remember, there is nothing inherent about the design of "mint one X stablecoin for $2 of collateral" that says that X needs to trade at $1.

Sorry, but Curve wars are dumb.

1) These features should've been built into Curve natively from the start. A product miss has spawned this entire industry.

2) This glosses over Curve losing stablecoin swap mkt share. You're bikeshedding while the shed is burning down behind you

Curve liquidity isn't for trading, it's for peg stability. The decrease in volume against uni v3 doesn't affect Curve's core value prop

Sorry, but Curve wars are dumb.

1) These features should've been built into Curve natively from the start. A product miss has spawned this entire industry.

2) This glosses over Curve losing stablecoin swap mkt share. You're bikeshedding while the shed is burning down behind you

Just gonna say it again. 

@etherscan is a monsters of a company. 

So important to the entire ecosystem. 

Thanks for the work you do.
------
it's pretty crazy how much room is still there to optimize the solana validator code. makes me think that 1M tps is definitely within reach in the future.
------
I see a bunch of low hanging fruit i.e. things that can be fixed in weeks not years. 

So devs (myself included) get upset or joke about this but underlying reality is nuanced. 

(btw Mango dev calls and Solana discord are good places to get that nuance)
------
mango perps are already 5bps taker and 4bps maker rebate, bringing in the fee spread gets you to 1bps taker (makers can widen by 4bps to simulate the rebate)

Just gonna say it again. 

@etherscan is a monsters of a company. 

So important to the entire ecosystem. 

Thanks for the work you do.
------
it's pretty crazy how much room is still there to optimize the solana validator code. makes me think that 1M tps is definitely within reach in the future.
------
I see a bunch of low hanging fruit i.e. things that can be fixed in weeks not years. 

So devs (myself included) get upset or joke about this but underlying reality is nuanced. 

(btw Mango dev calls and Solana discord are good places to get that nuance)
------
mango perps are already 5bps taker and 4bps maker rebate, bringing in the fee spread gets you to 1bps taker (makers can widen by 4bps to simulate the rebate)
------
Dydx fees now competitive with mango. Mango DAO please do something twitter.com/AntonioMJulian…

100% agree, a few months ago I would have said that on chain privacy is nice but still niche

my view has shifted in the last month or so though and I strongly believe that privacy is a necessity for any blockchain that wants real world adoption
------
i don't understand the "mass surveillance is bad, but mass financial surveillance is not" people. do you not realize that literally everything anyone does requires usage of the financial system and therefore mass financial surveillance is mass surveillance
------
disagree, I think there needs to be room for others to try things that the ethereum community may not believe will work.

and yes, part of that is marketing rather than any sort of technological innovations.

I feel the same about L1s. The majority of them focus on community development to pump the token, then wait for Ethereum to solve the outstanding problems (PBS, protocol MEV, stateless verification, history+state expiry, wallet UX, etc). twitter.com/lightclients/s…

while txs under a dollar are a great and hats off to the optimism team, i feel like txs need to be under 1 cent to enable 90% of real world applications to move on chain

Curve liquidity isn't for trading, it's for peg stability. The decrease in volume against uni v3 doesn't affect Curve's core value prop

Remember, there is nothing inherent about the design of "mint one X stablecoin for $2 of collateral" that says that X needs to trade at $1.

Sorry, but Curve wars are dumb.

1) These features should've been built into Curve natively from the start. A product miss has spawned this entire industry.

2) This glosses over Curve losing stablecoin swap mkt share. You're bikeshedding while the shed is burning down behind you

Curve liquidity isn't for trading, it's for peg stability. The decrease in volume against uni v3 doesn't affect Curve's core value prop

Sorry, but Curve wars are dumb.

1) These features should've been built into Curve natively from the start. A product miss has spawned this entire industry.

2) This glosses over Curve losing stablecoin swap mkt share. You're bikeshedding while the shed is burning down behind you

Just gonna say it again. 

@etherscan is a monsters of a company. 

So important to the entire ecosystem. 

Thanks for the work you do.
------
it's pretty crazy how much room is still there to optimize the solana validator code. makes me think that 1M tps is definitely within reach in the future.
------
I see a bunch of low hanging fruit i.e. things that can be fixed in weeks not years. 

So devs (myself included) get upset or joke about this but underlying reality is nuanced. 

(btw Mango dev calls and Solana discord are good places to get that nuance)
------
mango perps are already 5bps taker and 4bps maker rebate, bringing in the fee spread gets you to 1bps taker (makers can widen by 4bps to simulate the rebate)

Just gonna say it again. 

@etherscan is a monsters of a company. 

So important to the entire ecosystem. 

Thanks for the work you do.
------
it's pretty crazy how much room is still there to optimize the solana validator code. makes me think that 1M tps is definitely within reach in the future.
------
I see a bunch of low hanging fruit i.e. things that can be fixed in weeks not years. 

So devs (myself included) get upset or joke about this but underlying reality is nuanced. 

(btw Mango dev calls and Solana discord are good places to get that nuance)
------
mango perps are already 5bps taker and 4bps maker rebate, bringing in the fee spread gets you to 1bps taker (makers can widen by 4bps to simulate the rebate)
------
Dydx fees now competitive with mango. Mango DAO please do something twitter.com/AntonioMJulian…

100% agree, a few months ago I would have said that on chain privacy is nice but still niche

my view has shifted in the last month or so though and I strongly believe that privacy is a necessity for any blockchain that wants real world adoption
------
i don't understand the "mass surveillance is bad, but mass financial surveillance is not" people. do you not realize that literally everything anyone does requires usage of the financial system and therefore mass financial surveillance is mass surveillance
------
disagree, I think there needs to be room for others to try things that the ethereum community may not believe will work.

and yes, part of that is marketing rather than any sort of technological innovations.

I feel the same about L1s. The majority of them focus on community development to pump the token, then wait for Ethereum to solve the outstanding problems (PBS, protocol MEV, stateless verification, history+state expiry, wallet UX, etc). twitter.com/lightclients/s…

while txs under a dollar are a great and hats off to the optimism team, i feel like txs need to be under 1 cent to enable 90% of real world applications to move on chain

Curve liquidity isn't for trading, it's for peg stability. The decrease in volume against uni v3 doesn't affect Curve's core value prop

Remember, there is nothing inherent about the design of "mint one X stablecoin for $2 of collateral" that says that X needs to trade at $1.

Sorry, but Curve wars are dumb.

1) These features should've been built into Curve natively from the start. A product miss has spawned this entire industry.

2) This glosses over Curve losing stablecoin swap mkt share. You're bikeshedding while the shed is burning down behind you

Curve liquidity isn't for trading, it's for peg stability. The decrease in volume against uni v3 doesn't affect Curve's core value prop

Sorry, but Curve wars are dumb.

1) These features should've been built into Curve natively from the start. A product miss has spawned this entire industry.

2) This glosses over Curve losing stablecoin swap mkt share. You're bikeshedding while the shed is burning down behind you

Just gonna say it again. 

@etherscan is a monsters of a company. 

So important to the entire ecosystem. 

Thanks for the work you do.
------
it's pretty crazy how much room is still there to optimize the solana validator code. makes me think that 1M tps is definitely within reach in the future.
------
I see a bunch of low hanging fruit i.e. things that can be fixed in weeks not years. 

So devs (myself included) get upset or joke about this but underlying reality is nuanced. 

(btw Mango dev calls and Solana discord are good places to get that nuance)
------
mango perps are already 5bps taker and 4bps maker rebate, bringing in the fee spread gets you to 1bps taker (makers can widen by 4bps to simulate the rebate)

Just gonna say it again. 

@etherscan is a monsters of a company. 

So important to the entire ecosystem. 

Thanks for the work you do.
------
it's pretty crazy how much room is still there to optimize the solana validator code. makes me think that 1M tps is definitely within reach in the future.
------
I see a bunch of low hanging fruit i.e. things that can be fixed in weeks not years. 

So devs (myself included) get upset or joke about this but underlying reality is nuanced. 

(btw Mango dev calls and Solana discord are good places to get that nuance)
------
mango perps are already 5bps taker and 4bps maker rebate, bringing in the fee spread gets you to 1bps taker (makers can widen by 4bps to simulate the rebate)
------
Dydx fees now competitive with mango. Mango DAO please do something twitter.com/AntonioMJulian…

100% agree, a few months ago I would have said that on chain privacy is nice but still niche

my view has shifted in the last month or so though and I strongly believe that privacy is a necessity for any blockchain that wants real world adoption
------
i don't understand the "mass surveillance is bad, but mass financial surveillance is not" people. do you not realize that literally everything anyone does requires usage of the financial system and therefore mass financial surveillance is mass surveillance
------
disagree, I think there needs to be room for others to try things that the ethereum community may not believe will work.

and yes, part of that is marketing rather than any sort of technological innovations.

I feel the same about L1s. The majority of them focus on community development to pump the token, then wait for Ethereum to solve the outstanding problems (PBS, protocol MEV, stateless verification, history+state expiry, wallet UX, etc). twitter.com/lightclients/s…

while txs under a dollar are a great and hats off to the optimism team, i feel like txs need to be under 1 cent to enable 90% of real world applications to move on chain

Curve liquidity isn't for trading, it's for peg stability. The decrease in volume against uni v3 doesn't affect Curve's core value prop

Remember, there is nothing inherent about the design of "mint one X stablecoin for $2 of collateral" that says that X needs to trade at $1.

Sorry, but Curve wars are dumb.

1) These features should've been built into Curve natively from the start. A product miss has spawned this entire industry.

2) This glosses over Curve losing stablecoin swap mkt share. You're bikeshedding while the shed is burning down behind you

Curve liquidity isn't for trading, it's for peg stability. The decrease in volume against uni v3 doesn't affect Curve's core value prop

Sorry, but Curve wars are dumb.

1) These features should've been built into Curve natively from the start. A product miss has spawned this entire industry.

2) This glosses over Curve losing stablecoin swap mkt share. You're bikeshedding while the shed is burning down behind you

Just gonna say it again. 

@etherscan is a monsters of a company. 

So important to the entire ecosystem. 

Thanks for the work you do.
------
it's pretty crazy how much room is still there to optimize the solana validator code. makes me think that 1M tps is definitely within reach in the future.
------
I see a bunch of low hanging fruit i.e. things that can be fixed in weeks not years. 

So devs (myself included) get upset or joke about this but underlying reality is nuanced. 

(btw Mango dev calls and Solana discord are good places to get that nuance)
------
mango perps are already 5bps taker and 4bps maker rebate, bringing in the fee spread gets you to 1bps taker (makers can widen by 4bps to simulate the rebate)

Just gonna say it again. 

@etherscan is a monsters of a company. 

So important to the entire ecosystem. 

Thanks for the work you do.
------
it's pretty crazy how much room is still there to optimize the solana validator code. makes me think that 1M tps is definitely within reach in the future.
------
I see a bunch of low hanging fruit i.e. things that can be fixed in weeks not years. 

So devs (myself included) get upset or joke about this but underlying reality is nuanced. 

(btw Mango dev calls and Solana discord are good places to get that nuance)
------
mango perps are already 5bps taker and 4bps maker rebate, bringing in the fee spread gets you to 1bps taker (makers can widen by 4bps to simulate the rebate)
------
Dydx fees now competitive with mango. Mango DAO please do something twitter.com/AntonioMJulian…

100% agree, a few months ago I would have said that on chain privacy is nice but still niche

my view has shifted in the last month or so though and I strongly believe that privacy is a necessity for any blockchain that wants real world adoption
------
i don't understand the "mass surveillance is bad, but mass financial surveillance is not" people. do you not realize that literally everything anyone does requires usage of the financial system and therefore mass financial surveillance is mass surveillance
------
disagree, I think there needs to be room for others to try things that the ethereum community may not believe will work.

and yes, part of that is marketing rather than any sort of technological innovations.

I feel the same about L1s. The majority of them focus on community development to pump the token, then wait for Ethereum to solve the outstanding problems (PBS, protocol MEV, stateless verification, history+state expiry, wallet UX, etc). twitter.com/lightclients/s…

while txs under a dollar are a great and hats off to the optimism team, i feel like txs need to be under 1 cent to enable 90% of real world applications to move on chain

Curve liquidity isn't for trading, it's for peg stability. The decrease in volume against uni v3 doesn't affect Curve's core value prop

Remember, there is nothing inherent about the design of "mint one X stablecoin for $2 of collateral" that says that X needs to trade at $1.

Sorry, but Curve wars are dumb.

1) These features should've been built into Curve natively from the start. A product miss has spawned this entire industry.

2) This glosses over Curve losing stablecoin swap mkt share. You're bikeshedding while the shed is burning down behind you

Curve liquidity isn't for trading, it's for peg stability. The decrease in volume against uni v3 doesn't affect Curve's core value prop

Sorry, but Curve wars are dumb.

1) These features should've been built into Curve natively from the start. A product miss has spawned this entire industry.

2) This glosses over Curve losing stablecoin swap mkt share. You're bikeshedding while the shed is burning down behind you

Just gonna say it again. 

@etherscan is a monsters of a company. 

So important to the entire ecosystem. 

Thanks for the work you do.
------
it's pretty crazy how much room is still there to optimize the solana validator code. makes me think that 1M tps is definitely within reach in the future.
------
I see a bunch of low hanging fruit i.e. things that can be fixed in weeks not years. 

So devs (myself included) get upset or joke about this but underlying reality is nuanced. 

(btw Mango dev calls and Solana discord are good places to get that nuance)
------
mango perps are already 5bps taker and 4bps maker rebate, bringing in the fee spread gets you to 1bps taker (makers can widen by 4bps to simulate the rebate)

Just gonna say it again. 

@etherscan is a monsters of a company. 

So important to the entire ecosystem. 

Thanks for the work you do.
------
it's pretty crazy how much room is still there to optimize the solana validator code. makes me think that 1M tps is definitely within reach in the future.
------
I see a bunch of low hanging fruit i.e. things that can be fixed in weeks not years. 

So devs (myself included) get upset or joke about this but underlying reality is nuanced. 

(btw Mango dev calls and Solana discord are good places to get that nuance)
------
mango perps are already 5bps taker and 4bps maker rebate, bringing in the fee spread gets you to 1bps taker (makers can widen by 4bps to simulate the rebate)
------
Dydx fees now competitive with mango. Mango DAO please do something twitter.com/AntonioMJulian…

100% agree, a few months ago I would have said that on chain privacy is nice but still niche

my view has shifted in the last month or so though and I strongly believe that privacy is a necessity for any blockchain that wants real world adoption
------
i don't understand the "mass surveillance is bad, but mass financial surveillance is not" people. do you not realize that literally everything anyone does requires usage of the financial system and therefore mass financial surveillance is mass surveillance
------
disagree, I think there needs to be room for others to try things that the ethereum community may not believe will work.

and yes, part of that is marketing rather than any sort of technological innovations.

I feel the same about L1s. The majority of them focus on community development to pump the token, then wait for Ethereum to solve the outstanding problems (PBS, protocol MEV, stateless verification, history+state expiry, wallet UX, etc). twitter.com/lightclients/s…

while txs under a dollar are a great and hats off to the optimism team, i feel like txs need to be under 1 cent to enable 90% of real world applications to move on chain

Curve liquidity isn't for trading, it's for peg stability. The decrease in volume against uni v3 doesn't affect Curve's core value prop

Remember, there is nothing inherent about the design of "mint one X stablecoin for $2 of collateral" that says that X needs to trade at $1.

Sorry, but Curve wars are dumb.

1) These features should've been built into Curve natively from the start. A product miss has spawned this entire industry.

2) This glosses over Curve losing stablecoin swap mkt share. You're bikeshedding while the shed is burning down behind you

Curve liquidity isn't for trading, it's for peg stability. The decrease in volume against uni v3 doesn't affect Curve's core value prop

Sorry, but Curve wars are dumb.

1) These features should've been built into Curve natively from the start. A product miss has spawned this entire industry.

2) This glosses over Curve losing stablecoin swap mkt share. You're bikeshedding while the shed is burning down behind you

Just gonna say it again. 

@etherscan is a monsters of a company. 

So important to the entire ecosystem. 

Thanks for the work you do.
------
it's pretty crazy how much room is still there to optimize the solana validator code. makes me think that 1M tps is definitely within reach in the future.
------
I see a bunch of low hanging fruit i.e. things that can be fixed in weeks not years. 

So devs (myself included) get upset or joke about this but underlying reality is nuanced. 

(btw Mango dev calls and Solana discord are good places to get that nuance)
------
mango perps are already 5bps taker and 4bps maker rebate, bringing in the fee spread gets you to 1bps taker (makers can widen by 4bps to simulate the rebate)

Just gonna say it again. 

@etherscan is a monsters of a company. 

So important to the entire ecosystem. 

Thanks for the work you do.
------
it's pretty crazy how much room is still there to optimize the solana validator code. makes me think that 1M tps is definitely within reach in the future.
------
I see a bunch of low hanging fruit i.e. things that can be fixed in weeks not years. 

So devs (myself included) get upset or joke about this but underlying reality is nuanced. 

(btw Mango dev calls and Solana discord are good places to get that nuance)
------
mango perps are already 5bps taker and 4bps maker rebate, bringing in the fee spread gets you to 1bps taker (makers can widen by 4bps to simulate the rebate)
------
Dydx fees now competitive with mango. Mango DAO please do something twitter.com/AntonioMJulian…

100% agree, a few months ago I would have said that on chain privacy is nice but still niche

my view has shifted in the last month or so though and I strongly believe that privacy is a necessity for any blockchain that wants real world adoption
------
i don't understand the "mass surveillance is bad, but mass financial surveillance is not" people. do you not realize that literally everything anyone does requires usage of the financial system and therefore mass financial surveillance is mass surveillance
------
disagree, I think there needs to be room for others to try things that the ethereum community may not believe will work.

and yes, part of that is marketing rather than any sort of technological innovations.

I feel the same about L1s. The majority of them focus on community development to pump the token, then wait for Ethereum to solve the outstanding problems (PBS, protocol MEV, stateless verification, history+state expiry, wallet UX, etc). twitter.com/lightclients/s…

while txs under a dollar are a great and hats off to the optimism team, i feel like txs need to be under 1 cent to enable 90% of real world applications to move on chain

Curve liquidity isn't for trading, it's for peg stability. The decrease in volume against uni v3 doesn't affect Curve's core value prop

Remember, there is nothing inherent about the design of "mint one X stablecoin for $2 of collateral" that says that X needs to trade at $1.

Sorry, but Curve wars are dumb.

1) These features should've been built into Curve natively from the start. A product miss has spawned this entire industry.

2) This glosses over Curve losing stablecoin swap mkt share. You're bikeshedding while the shed is burning down behind you

Curve liquidity isn't for trading, it's for peg stability. The decrease in volume against uni v3 doesn't affect Curve's core value prop

Sorry, but Curve wars are dumb.

1) These features should've been built into Curve natively from the start. A product miss has spawned this entire industry.

2) This glosses over Curve losing stablecoin swap mkt share. You're bikeshedding while the shed is burning down behind you

Just gonna say it again. 

@etherscan is a monsters of a company. 

So important to the entire ecosystem. 

Thanks for the work you do.
------
it's pretty crazy how much room is still there to optimize the solana validator code. makes me think that 1M tps is definitely within reach in the future.
------
I see a bunch of low hanging fruit i.e. things that can be fixed in weeks not years. 

So devs (myself included) get upset or joke about this but underlying reality is nuanced. 

(btw Mango dev calls and Solana discord are good places to get that nuance)
------
mango perps are already 5bps taker and 4bps maker rebate, bringing in the fee spread gets you to 1bps taker (makers can widen by 4bps to simulate the rebate)

Just gonna say it again. 

@etherscan is a monsters of a company. 

So important to the entire ecosystem. 

Thanks for the work you do.
------
it's pretty crazy how much room is still there to optimize the solana validator code. makes me think that 1M tps is definitely within reach in the future.
------
I see a bunch of low hanging fruit i.e. things that can be fixed in weeks not years. 

So devs (myself included) get upset or joke about this but underlying reality is nuanced. 

(btw Mango dev calls and Solana discord are good places to get that nuance)
------
mango perps are already 5bps taker and 4bps maker rebate, bringing in the fee spread gets you to 1bps taker (makers can widen by 4bps to simulate the rebate)
------
Dydx fees now competitive with mango. Mango DAO please do something twitter.com/AntonioMJulian…

100% agree, a few months ago I would have said that on chain privacy is nice but still niche

my view has shifted in the last month or so though and I strongly believe that privacy is a necessity for any blockchain that wants real world adoption
------
i don't understand the "mass surveillance is bad, but mass financial surveillance is not" people. do you not realize that literally everything anyone does requires usage of the financial system and therefore mass financial surveillance is mass surveillance
------
disagree, I think there needs to be room for others to try things that the ethereum community may not believe will work.

and yes, part of that is marketing rather than any sort of technological innovations.

I feel the same about L1s. The majority of them focus on community development to pump the token, then wait for Ethereum to solve the outstanding problems (PBS, protocol MEV, stateless verification, history+state expiry, wallet UX, etc). twitter.com/lightclients/s…

while txs under a dollar are a great and hats off to the optimism team, i feel like txs need to be under 1 cent to enable 90% of real world applications to move on chain

Curve liquidity isn't for trading, it's for peg stability. The decrease in volume against uni v3 doesn't affect Curve's core value prop

Remember, there is nothing inherent about the design of "mint one X stablecoin for $2 of collateral" that says that X needs to trade at $1.

Sorry, but Curve wars are dumb.

1) These features should've been built into Curve natively from the start. A product miss has spawned this entire industry.

2) This glosses over Curve losing stablecoin swap mkt share. You're bikeshedding while the shed is burning down behind you

Curve liquidity isn't for trading, it's for peg stability. The decrease in volume against uni v3 doesn't affect Curve's core value prop

Sorry, but Curve wars are dumb.

1) These features should've been built into Curve natively from the start. A product miss has spawned this entire industry.

2) This glosses over Curve losing stablecoin swap mkt share. You're bikeshedding while the shed is burning down behind you

Just gonna say it again. 

@etherscan is a monsters of a company. 

So important to the entire ecosystem. 

Thanks for the work you do.
------
it's pretty crazy how much room is still there to optimize the solana validator code. makes me think that 1M tps is definitely within reach in the future.
------
I see a bunch of low hanging fruit i.e. things that can be fixed in weeks not years. 

So devs (myself included) get upset or joke about this but underlying reality is nuanced. 

(btw Mango dev calls and Solana discord are good places to get that nuance)
------
mango perps are already 5bps taker and 4bps maker rebate, bringing in the fee spread gets you to 1bps taker (makers can widen by 4bps to simulate the rebate)

Just gonna say it again. 

@etherscan is a monsters of a company. 

So important to the entire ecosystem. 

Thanks for the work you do.
------
it's pretty crazy how much room is still there to optimize the solana validator code. makes me think that 1M tps is definitely within reach in the future.
------
I see a bunch of low hanging fruit i.e. things that can be fixed in weeks not years. 

So devs (myself included) get upset or joke about this but underlying reality is nuanced. 

(btw Mango dev calls and Solana discord are good places to get that nuance)
------
mango perps are already 5bps taker and 4bps maker rebate, bringing in the fee spread gets you to 1bps taker (makers can widen by 4bps to simulate the rebate)
------
Dydx fees now competitive with mango. Mango DAO please do something twitter.com/AntonioMJulian…

100% agree, a few months ago I would have said that on chain privacy is nice but still niche

my view has shifted in the last month or so though and I strongly believe that privacy is a necessity for any blockchain that wants real world adoption
------
i don't understand the "mass surveillance is bad, but mass financial surveillance is not" people. do you not realize that literally everything anyone does requires usage of the financial system and therefore mass financial surveillance is mass surveillance
------
disagree, I think there needs to be room for others to try things that the ethereum community may not believe will work.

and yes, part of that is marketing rather than any sort of technological innovations.

I feel the same about L1s. The majority of them focus on community development to pump the token, then wait for Ethereum to solve the outstanding problems (PBS, protocol MEV, stateless verification, history+state expiry, wallet UX, etc). twitter.com/lightclients/s…

while txs under a dollar are a great and hats off to the optimism team, i feel like txs need to be under 1 cent to enable 90% of real world applications to move on chain

Curve liquidity isn't for trading, it's for peg stability. The decrease in volume against uni v3 doesn't affect Curve's core value prop

Remember, there is nothing inherent about the design of "mint one X stablecoin for $2 of collateral" that says that X needs to trade at $1.

Sorry, but Curve wars are dumb.

1) These features should've been built into Curve natively from the start. A product miss has spawned this entire industry.

2) This glosses over Curve losing stablecoin swap mkt share. You're bikeshedding while the shed is burning down behind you

Curve liquidity isn't for trading, it's for peg stability. The decrease in volume against uni v3 doesn't affect Curve's core value prop

Sorry, but Curve wars are dumb.

1) These features should've been built into Curve natively from the start. A product miss has spawned this entire industry.

2) This glosses over Curve losing stablecoin swap mkt share. You're bikeshedding while the shed is burning down behind you

Just gonna say it again. 

@etherscan is a monsters of a company. 

So important to the entire ecosystem. 

Thanks for the work you do.
------
it's pretty crazy how much room is still there to optimize the solana validator code. makes me think that 1M tps is definitely within reach in the future.
------
I see a bunch of low hanging fruit i.e. things that can be fixed in weeks not years. 

So devs (myself included) get upset or joke about this but underlying reality is nuanced. 

(btw Mango dev calls and Solana discord are good places to get that nuance)
------
mango perps are already 5bps taker and 4bps maker rebate, bringing in the fee spread gets you to 1bps taker (makers can widen by 4bps to simulate the rebate)

Just gonna say it again. 

@etherscan is a monsters of a company. 

So important to the entire ecosystem. 

Thanks for the work you do.
------
it's pretty crazy how much room is still there to optimize the solana validator code. makes me think that 1M tps is definitely within reach in the future.
------
I see a bunch of low hanging fruit i.e. things that can be fixed in weeks not years. 

So devs (myself included) get upset or joke about this but underlying reality is nuanced. 

(btw Mango dev calls and Solana discord are good places to get that nuance)
------
mango perps are already 5bps taker and 4bps maker rebate, bringing in the fee spread gets you to 1bps taker (makers can widen by 4bps to simulate the rebate)
------
Dydx fees now competitive with mango. Mango DAO please do something twitter.com/AntonioMJulian…

100% agree, a few months ago I would have said that on chain privacy is nice but still niche

my view has shifted in the last month or so though and I strongly believe that privacy is a necessity for any blockchain that wants real world adoption
------
i don't understand the "mass surveillance is bad, but mass financial surveillance is not" people. do you not realize that literally everything anyone does requires usage of the financial system and therefore mass financial surveillance is mass surveillance
------
disagree, I think there needs to be room for others to try things that the ethereum community may not believe will work.

and yes, part of that is marketing rather than any sort of technological innovations.

I feel the same about L1s. The majority of them focus on community development to pump the token, then wait for Ethereum to solve the outstanding problems (PBS, protocol MEV, stateless verification, history+state expiry, wallet UX, etc). twitter.com/lightclients/s…

while txs under a dollar are a great and hats off to the optimism team, i feel like txs need to be under 1 cent to enable 90% of real world applications to move on chain

Curve liquidity isn't for trading, it's for peg stability. The decrease in volume against uni v3 doesn't affect Curve's core value prop

Remember, there is nothing inherent about the design of "mint one X stablecoin for $2 of collateral" that says that X needs to trade at $1.

Sorry, but Curve wars are dumb.

1) These features should've been built into Curve natively from the start. A product miss has spawned this entire industry.

2) This glosses over Curve losing stablecoin swap mkt share. You're bikeshedding while the shed is burning down behind you

100% agree, a few months ago I would have said that on chain privacy is nice but still niche

my view has shifted in the last month or so though and I strongly believe that privacy is a necessity for any blockchain that wants real world adoption

i don't understand the "mass surveillance is bad, but mass financial surveillance is not" people. do you not realize that literally everything anyone does requires usage of the financial system and therefore mass financial surveillance is mass surveillance
------
disagree, I think there needs to be room for others to try things that the ethereum community may not believe will work.

and yes, part of that is marketing rather than any sort of technological innovations.

I feel the same about L1s. The majority of them focus on community development to pump the token, then wait for Ethereum to solve the outstanding problems (PBS, protocol MEV, stateless verification, history+state expiry, wallet UX, etc). twitter.com/lightclients/s…

while txs under a dollar are a great and hats off to the optimism team, i feel like txs need to be under 1 cent to enable 90% of real world applications to move on chain

Think we can get this down to a dollar pretty soon...

Curve liquidity isn't for trading, it's for peg stability. The decrease in volume against uni v3 doesn't affect Curve's core value prop

Remember, there is nothing inherent about the design of "mint one X stablecoin for $2 of collateral" that says that X needs to trade at $1.

Sorry, but Curve wars are dumb.

1) These features should've been built into Curve natively from the start. A product miss has spawned this entire industry.

2) This glosses over Curve losing stablecoin swap mkt share. You're bikeshedding while the shed is burning down behind you

if ETH fees were reduced 100x, what would happen to alt L1s?

I think Solana, Near, and Cosmos eco would survive, but the EVM chains would likely die https://twitter.com/moneywithcarter/status/1483501490354503682…

imagine if the evm itself were subject to as much optimization work as the programs that are being run on it

games are underrated in developing the ability to think quickly under pressure. hard to get practice operating in such situations in real life, but easy in games. https://twitter.com/kerimrocks/status/1483535082652684295…

pls can we have support for generating svgs on the fly inside on chain instructions like ERC721s

Just gonna say it again. 

@etherscan is a monsters of a company. 

So important to the entire ecosystem. 

Thanks for the work you do.
------
it's pretty crazy how much room is still there to optimize the solana validator code. makes me think that 1M tps is definitely within reach in the future.
------
I see a bunch of low hanging fruit i.e. things that can be fixed in weeks not years. 

So devs (myself included) get upset or joke about this but underlying reality is nuanced. 

(btw Mango dev calls and Solana discord are good places to get that nuance)
------
mango perps are already 5bps taker and 4bps maker rebate, bringing in the fee spread gets you to 1bps taker (makers can widen by 4bps to simulate the rebate)
