Not just the laws of physics, but also computer science/complexity and game theory.

Mathematics and physics fundamentals do not change, no matter the scale of the intelligence.

Doomer arguments simply do not hold.

The biggest flaw in their arguments is that they seem to think the laws of Physics are conditional, and that with enough intelligence they stop mattering.

Major flaw in the disassembly argument: "negentropy" is free energy, there is far more free energy in inactive matter than human biomass, and the expected free energy cost of going to war is very high, making the expected ROI negative

How do the pause/stop AI people plan to pause/stop global AI dev?

Feels like the statistical risk of nuclear war ending the world is higher than "AI kill us all" if we play out enforcement of this policy.

china suppressed its working class and overbuilt infrastructure because it lacks market & democratic feedback mechanisms that would have forced better capital allocation and facilitated bargaining between different sectors of the economy? that’s crazy

The notion of humanity will asymptomatically drift and that is a simple fact. 

In the short and medium to long term climbing the Kardashev scale is the best way for humans to live better more numerous and prosperous lives. 

AGI will be needed to climb the Kardashev scale.

My favorite example: one of the alumni is a Mexican investment banker who first worked for Morgan Stanley (managing a portfolio of $2 bil) but  has now started the Shrimp Welfare Project. This may sound weird, but shrimp welfare is a *huge* issue. https://shrimpwelfareproject.org /28

LK-99: The Case for Skepticism

By now there's been a number of replications, videos, pre-prints on arxiv, and at-home or at-work attempts to reproduce the original findings of Lee and Kim. 

Here's why I'm increasingly skeptical on LK-99 and my reasoning:

The notion of humanity will asymptomatically drift and that is a simple fact. 

In the short and medium to long term climbing the Kardashev scale is the best way for humans to live better more numerous and prosperous lives. 

AGI will be needed to climb the Kardashev scale.

I forgot about this particular episode of institutional collapse

MIT got sued by a group of deaf activists because opencourseware didn't have captions on a bunch of lecture vids so MIT's administration was like "bet, we'll just delete most of it" and settled the case twitter.com/docentdemagogu…

We can build our way out of our problems.

This seems like a great way for builders to meet up to figure out how to fix our tech mecca.

Meissner effect or bust: Day 8.5

We made the rocks
------
The effects grows every day, talking with newly minted founders - many want change, a better life, a better way to do things.

The old ways is slow. In the last couple of weeks, we've grown from 100s to 1000s by next year we'll grow to millions. Millions who want a better world.

This is the e/acc hyperstitious effect.

By encouraging one another in the community to aim higher, the optimism spreads in an infectious manner and unlocks latent value towards techno-capital acceleration within the population that was dormant.

e/acc is dealing with reality on reality's terms

Hearing stories of people meeting co-founders through e/acc Twitter

Really warms my heart to hear stories like this

At the end of the day, this is what it's all about, a community of builders from around the world from which sparks can emanate

Accelerate, fellow builders

Phonons are vibes in matter from nuclei shaking. Electrons tend to get randomly whacked by these vibes on their way through a material, creating resistance. Lead nuclei are heavy af hence don't budge as much. Copper is a goated conductor.

In retrospect, it was obvious.

Overregulation a way to neuter the West's technological progress. Decels are useful idiots to foreign adversaries. It's all psyops to win the growth race. Deceleration for thee but not for me.

lmaoo? http://ai.com used to redirect to chatgpt, and now it redirects to http://x.ai ? did musk just buy it off openai?

also kinda annoying coz i always used it to go to chatgpt but i guess not enough people must have, so that openai was willing to sell it

Caution, anons.

One preprint and a DFT does not a breakthrough make. Science is full of heartbreaking moments and hoaxes.

We must accelerate but only wisely. Too much hype can cause terrible side effects, including cold, cold winters.

The forward flow of time is defined by the degree of irreversibility, which is proportional to the rate of entropy production / heat dissipation. 

Thus maximizing free energy capture and heat dissipation is literally accelerating the passage of time in this interpretation.

The reality is we don't really understand the flow of time other than through thermodynamics.

So if you define the flow of time in terms of irreversibility of processes, then life and intelligence literally accelerate the flow of this notion of time (entropy production)

The physics case against UBI.

It's terrible, no incentive gradient. Waste of capital. 

A constant energy shift doesn't affect dynamics of a thermodynamic system (only depends on energy difference/gradients).

Capital <> energy in this analogy.

Dynamics are unaffected yet UBI will cost capital. Bad.

Our problem is that we are a small civilization with small ambitions with the technology to reshape planets. We have no use for technology that can feed 100s of billions or using up the minerals of even one planet, let alone capturing the energy of stars.

Degrowth is anti-life, anti-nature. It is accepting slow death, condemning all life on Earth to perish as our sun withers.

The only way out is to grow humanity’s leverage (energy, force, compute) in order to climb the Kardashev scale.

Without us, life on Earth is doomed.

Accelerationism is back, with everyone from @garrytan to @pmarca rocking the "e/acc" now.

Not many people know that "e/acc" is a resurgence of an obscure theory circle I was involved in, on Twitter, about 6 years ago.

That's all it's about. We must keep going.

Climbing the Kardashev gradient enables more humans by design. Decels would rather have a managed decline and zero-sum management of shrinking resources rather than growing the pie. This is why fighting for e/acc is fighting for existence of future humans. It is the moral thing.
------
"lucky"? It's literally by design.

 e.g. Haber-Bosch process is enabled by science + energy production, it substantially increases the carrying capacity of our civilization.

Climbing the Kardashev scale is *the* metric to optimize in order to be able to sustain more humans.

This is the best feeling in the world. Builders understand.

I've definitely just made the best thing I've ever made.

I can't fucking believe it works.

More humans today isn't the product of deliberate thinking of humans 100 years ago, we're a lucky byproduct resulting from our ancestors pursuing their selfish interests, not a result of them designing our future.

In 2013, 85% of Americans aged 18-29 said they were either "extremely" or "very" proud to be an American.

Dissipatively adapting my peripheral neural system through resistance of external forces in repeated fashion, optimizing neuroplasticity with stimulants and exogenous phononic signals for optimal dopaminergic and adrenergic priming

Doesn't just have to be coding, all sorts of builders or all kinds can contribute to the acceleration. 

Coding is of course an extremely high leverage way to build though. AI prompt programming is meta-coding and even higher leverage. Whatever fits your skillset anon. Go build!

As was prophesized, all the TPOT "free thinkers" that always have to be second-order contrarian (against first-order-contrarian opinions) are suddenly coming out of the woodwork to farm clout now that e/acc is becoming mainstream. 

Predictable, low-entropy move, do better.
------
The only resistance to e/acc comes from people who have the hubris of thinking they can fully predict and/or control the future with certainty. 

These people are deeply naive and are clinging on to determinism is a natively probabilistic world.
------
You can’t make or pin e/acc on limit arguments about where humanity’s future would stand when the unknowns are incalculable. Neutrality in this case is just recognising that the future is unclear. Meanwhile Kardashev-maxxing remains not just a good, but a moral imperative.

The interaction graph of TPOT has much higher internal volume to area ratio, due to the local cliquiness; it's a literal deep pocket in the interaction graph with narrow mouth; most recommendation engine local random walks thus lead to TPOT & can't statistically leave.

discrete differential geometry of interaction graphs explains TPOT's growth and inevitable gravitational pull of more mainstream Tweeters

I think it's literally akin to gravity

I think we could show this mathematically, the ratio of volume to area is another way to define curvature, so TPOT has a literal analogue of gravitational pull

AI doomers asking for centralization of AI capabilities:

There is no intent in AI. Humans give it intent. 

AI is powerful. Power is corrupting. Too much AI power in the hands of the few is too dangerous.

You want way more good humans than bad humans to have it.

Open source and accelerationism is the way.

Adversarial equilibrium is the only stable solution for concentrations of power

Centralized top-down control is too corruptible and hence far more dangerous

The interaction graph of TPOT has much higher internal volume to area ratio, due to the local cliquiness; it's a literal deep pocket in the interaction graph with narrow mouth; most recommendation engine local random walks thus lead to TPOT & can't statistically leave.

discrete differential geometry of interaction graphs explains TPOT's growth and inevitable gravitational pull of more mainstream Tweeters

I think it's literally akin to gravity

I think we could show this mathematically, the ratio of volume to area is another way to define curvature, so TPOT has a literal analogue of gravitational pull

We're going to build our way out of this. Nuclear fusion, nuclear fusion, and carbon capture are the way forward, not degrowth.

On a very long timescale, transhumanism might yield a species that doesn't look like anything we currently think of as human.

We have to be fine with evolutionary drift, anchoring ourselves to present day humanity forever makes no sense and ensures we are not adapting… Show more

As I’ve grown tired of reading the walls of text from AI pessimists, here is a summary of their proposed solutions:

1.) They suggest we’re all going to die from AI, so we should just resign ourselves to living in fear.

Many superintelligences, all in a dynamic equilibrium - with some form of collaboration, competition, property, trade, and law.

There is, as usual, no evidence mentioned for the claim that superintelligence requires totalitarianism, nor is that evidence that that's a good thing. https://twitter.com/YaBoyFathoM/status/1681345979646197766…

speed limiting computers is an incredibly brain dead idea. out of all ways to mitigate risk it seems like roughly the dumbest you could entertain. firstly bc it’s hopeless, second bc collateral damage, but also bc “*slower* universe-eating ai” is literally 0 alpha lmao
