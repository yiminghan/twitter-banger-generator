PetaFLOP/s-days is a terrible unit. I propose the "person" = 20 PFLOPS, and the "person-year".

GPT-3 was 1024 A100s for 34 days.
(1024*312e12*34 / (20e15*365))
1.5 person-years

GPT-4 was 25k A100s for 90 days.
(25e3*312e12*90 / (20e15*365))
96 person-years

Feels right.

We are a lot closer to the Landauer limit (lowest amount of energy for a gate) than I thought.

This chart isn't up to date, but assuming we got 2 more orders of magnitude in the last 13 years, we're at 1e-19 J. The limit is 3e-21 J. Only 10-100x off!

free/near free energy unlocks a chain of things that will lead to space holidays. firstly it will dump the prices of anything where energy is a big input, that will have network effects in every single market, etc. By far the biggest indicator of well being is energy consumption

Now that we have established consent with 72.8% desiring accelerationists, what are the next steps?

Forget the national elections, let's pull the Soros arbitrage move. Lobbying, zoning, local, etc..

one of the easiest policy wins i can imagine for the US is to reform high-skill immigration.

the fact that many of the most talented people in the world want to be here is a hard-won gift; embracing them is the key to keeping it that way.

Today we open-source a dataset of 100k heavily compressed driving videos for machine learning experiments. 

We included the encoder, the decoder, and the GPT model that generated the video below.

There are 2 challenges with $500 reward each.

------
A ResNet-50 in tinygrad with DEBUG=2
It uses 61 GPU kernels.

Color coding of dimensions:
Blue/Cyan: global/local (block/thread)
Red: reduce (loop)
Purple: reduce (unrolled) 
Yellow: upcasted
------
A good intro to the tiny corp for people who want to come work here.

Also the tiny corp is back on the "get AMD on MLPerf plan". Spoke with 
@LisaSu
, I do believe things will get better and AMD will begin to develop in public. 

1) Help out by doing bounties! $1,000 for finishing up the RDNA3 assembler
2) Preorder a tinybox

https://tinygrad.org
------
AMD (unlike Qualcomm) is a joy to buy chips from. 7.38 PFLOPS of compute was delivered today, with exaflops more to come.

Nice to see them more active on the ROCm GitHub, we are working on the layer above

Today we open-source a dataset of 100k heavily compressed driving videos for machine learning experiments. 

We included the encoder, the decoder, and the GPT model that generated the video below.

There are 2 challenges with $500 reward each.

we may not agree on many things, but this is one of the easiest changes the US can make that radically brightens our potential future.

it's literally free money for our country. and I don't know about you, but I like living in a rich country with smart people.
------
one of the easiest policy wins i can imagine for the US is to reform high-skill immigration.

the fact that many of the most talented people in the world want to be here is a hard-won gift; embracing them is the key to keeping it that way.

hard to get this back if we lose it.

Is there a difference between the AI control problem and the human control problem? And if you are (still) here for the drama, I talk about my Twitter internship.

After these new 15 minutes of fame are over and I return to the twitterless shadow realm, if you'd like to follow the tiny corp:

Our mission is "to commoditize the petaflop"

When the overlords come for your compute, don't get caught lackin.

Today we open-source a dataset of 100k heavily compressed driving videos for machine learning experiments. 

We included the encoder, the decoder, and the GPT model that generated the video below.

There are 2 challenges with $500 reward each.
https://github.com/commaai/commavq
------
A ResNet-50 in tinygrad with DEBUG=2
It uses 61 GPU kernels.

Color coding of dimensions:
Blue/Cyan: global/local (block/thread)
Red: reduce (loop)
Purple: reduce (unrolled) 
Yellow: upcasted
------
A good intro to the tiny corp for people who want to come work here.
------
Also the tiny corp is back on the "get AMD on MLPerf plan". Spoke with 
@LisaSu
, I do believe things will get better and AMD will begin to develop in public. 

1) Help out by doing bounties! $1,000 for finishing up the RDNA3 assembler
2) Preorder a tinybox

https://tinygrad.org
------
AMD (unlike Qualcomm) is a joy to buy chips from. 7.38 PFLOPS of compute was delivered today, with exaflops more to come.

Nice to see them more active on the ROCm GitHub, we are working on the layer above 
@__tinygrad__
------
tinybox in a living room, vaporwave, volumetric light, octane render, hyperrealistic
------
What have you done to make the blue line go up today?
------
Our ML simulation is getting better. This video is entirely imagined by a neural network.
------
I'm offering due diligence as a service. Before you invest millions into an AI or hard tech startup, hire me for $10K. I will evaluate feasibility of idea and realisticness of timeline given founder.

Send money before reach out, PayPal geohot@gmail.com. Will refund if not a fit
------
You know what else is funny?  Essentially no VC will pay for third party technical due diligence. They will place multi$M bets but won’t pay $10K to have actual subject matter expert take a deep dive on the tech first.

one of the easiest policy wins i can imagine for the US is to reform high-skill immigration.

the fact that many of the most talented people in the world want to be here is a hard-won gift; embracing them is the key to keeping it that way.

Today we open-source a dataset of 100k heavily compressed driving videos for machine learning experiments. 

We included the encoder, the decoder, and the GPT model that generated the video below.

There are 2 challenges with $500 reward each.

A ResNet-50 in tinygrad with DEBUG=2
It uses 61 GPU kernels.

Color coding of dimensions:
Blue/Cyan: global/local (block/thread)
Red: reduce (loop)
Purple: reduce (unrolled) 
Yellow: upcasted

A good intro to the tiny corp for people who want to come work here.

2) Preorder a tinybox

AMD (unlike Qualcomm) is a joy to buy chips from. 7.38 PFLOPS of compute was delivered today, with exaflops more to come.

Nice to see them more active on the ROCm GitHub, we are working on the layer above

I'm offering due diligence as a service. Before you invest millions into an AI or hard tech startup, hire me for $10K. I will evaluate feasibility of idea and realisticness of timeline given founder.

Send money before reach out, PayPal geohot@gmail.com. Will refund if not a fit

You know what else is funny?  Essentially no VC will pay for third party technical due diligence. They will place multi$M bets but won’t pay $10K to have actual subject matter expert take a deep dive on the tech first.

we may not agree on many things, but this is one of the easiest changes the US can make that radically brightens our potential future.

one of the easiest policy wins i can imagine for the US is to reform high-skill immigration.

the fact that many of the most talented people in the world want to be here is a hard-won gift; embracing them is the key to keeping it that way.

Today we open-source a dataset of 100k heavily compressed driving videos for machine learning experiments. 

We included the encoder, the decoder, and the GPT model that generated the video below.

There are 2 challenges with $500 reward each.
https://github.com/commaai/commavq
------
A ResNet-50 in tinygrad with DEBUG=2
It uses 61 GPU kernels.

Color coding of dimensions:
Blue/Cyan: global/local (block/thread)
Red: reduce (loop)
Purple: reduce (unrolled) 
Yellow: upcasted
------
A good intro to the tiny corp for people who want to come work here.

Also the tiny corp is back on the "get AMD on MLPerf plan". Spoke with 
@LisaSu
, I do believe things will get better and AMD will begin to develop in public. 

1) Help out by doing bounties! $1,000 for finishing up the RDNA3 assembler
2) Preorder a tinybox

https://tinygrad.org
------
AMD (unlike Qualcomm) is a joy to buy chips from. 7.38 PFLOPS of compute was delivered today, with exaflops more to come.

Nice to see them more active on the ROCm GitHub, we are working on the layer above

Today we open-source a dataset of 100k heavily compressed driving videos for machine learning experiments. 

We included the encoder, the decoder, and the GPT model that generated the video below.

There are 2 challenges with $500 reward each.

A ResNet-50 in tinygrad with DEBUG=2
It uses 61 GPU kernels.

Color coding of dimensions:
Blue/Cyan: global/local (block/thread)
Red: reduce (loop)
Purple: reduce (unrolled) 
Yellow: upcasted

A good intro to the tiny corp for people who want to come work here.

Also the tiny corp is back on the "get AMD on MLPerf plan". Spoke with

, I do believe things will get better and AMD will begin to develop in public. 

1) Help out by doing bounties! $1,000 for finishing up the RDNA3 assembler
2) Preorder a tinybox

AMD (unlike Qualcomm) is a joy to buy chips from. 7.38 PFLOPS of compute was delivered today, with exaflops more to come.

Nice to see them more active on the ROCm GitHub, we are working on the layer above

I'm offering due diligence as a service. Before you invest millions into an AI or hard tech startup, hire me for $10K. I will evaluate feasibility of idea and realisticness of timeline given founder.

Send money before reach out, PayPal geohot@gmail.com. Will refund if not a fit

You know what else is funny?  Essentially no VC will pay for third party technical due diligence. They will place multi$M bets but won’t pay $10K to have actual subject matter expert take a deep dive on the tech first.

we may not agree on many things, but this is one of the easiest changes the US can make that radically brightens our potential future.

it's literally free money for our country. and I don't know about you, but I like living in a rich country with smart people.

one of the easiest policy wins i can imagine for the US is to reform high-skill immigration.

the fact that many of the most talented people in the world want to be here is a hard-won gift; embracing them is the key to keeping it that way.

we may not agree on many things, but this is one of the easiest changes the US can make that radically brightens our potential future.

it's literally free money for our country. and I don't know about you, but I like living in a rich country with smart people.

one of the easiest policy wins i can imagine for the US is to reform high-skill immigration.

the fact that many of the most talented people in the world want to be here is a hard-won gift; embracing them is the key to keeping it that way.

hard to get this back if we lose it.

Today we open-source a dataset of 100k heavily compressed driving videos for machine learning experiments. 

We included the encoder, the decoder, and the GPT model that generated the video below.

There are 2 challenges with $500 reward each.

A ResNet-50 in tinygrad with DEBUG=2
It uses 61 GPU kernels.

Color coding of dimensions:
Blue/Cyan: global/local (block/thread)
Red: reduce (loop)
Purple: reduce (unrolled) 
Yellow: upcasted

A good intro to the tiny corp for people who want to come work here.

Also the tiny corp is back on the "get AMD on MLPerf plan". Spoke with 
@LisaSu
, I do believe things will get better and AMD will begin to develop in public. 

1) Help out by doing bounties! $1,000 for finishing up the RDNA3 assembler
2) Preorder a tinybox

https://tinygrad.org
------
AMD (unlike Qualcomm) is a joy to buy chips from. 7.38 PFLOPS of compute was delivered today, with exaflops more to come.

Nice to see them more active on the ROCm GitHub, we are working on the layer above

we may not agree on many things, but this is one of the easiest changes the US can make that radically brightens our potential future.

it's literally free money for our country. and I don't know about you, but I like living in a rich country with smart people.

one of the easiest policy wins i can imagine for the US is to reform high-skill immigration.

the fact that many of the most talented people in the world want to be here is a hard-won gift; embracing them is the key to keeping it that way.

hard to get this back if we lose it.

Is there a difference between the AI control problem and the human control problem? And if you are (still) here for the drama, I talk about my Twitter internship.

Today we open-source a dataset of 100k heavily compressed driving videos for machine learning experiments. 

We included the encoder, the decoder, and the GPT model that generated the video below.

There are 2 challenges with $500 reward each.
https://github.com/commaai/commavq
------
A ResNet-50 in tinygrad with DEBUG=2
It uses 61 GPU kernels.

Color coding of dimensions:
Blue/Cyan: global/local (block/thread)
Red: reduce (loop)
Purple: reduce (unrolled) 
Yellow: upcasted
------
A good intro to the tiny corp for people who want to come work here.

Also the tiny corp is back on the "get AMD on MLPerf plan". Spoke with 
@LisaSu
, I do believe things will get better and AMD will begin to develop in public. 

1) Help out by doing bounties! $1,000 for finishing up the RDNA3 assembler
2) Preorder a tinybox

https://tinygrad.org
------
AMD (unlike Qualcomm) is a joy to buy chips from. 7.38 PFLOPS of compute was delivered today, with exaflops more to come.

Nice to see them more active on the ROCm GitHub, we are working on the layer above

tinybox in a living room, vaporwave, volumetric light, octane render, hyperrealistic

What have you done to make the blue line go up today?
------
Our ML simulation is getting better. This video is entirely imagined by a neural network.
------
I'm offering due diligence as a service. Before you invest millions into an AI or hard tech startup, hire me for $10K. I will evaluate feasibility of idea and realisticness of timeline given founder.

Send money before reach out, PayPal geohot@gmail.com. Will refund if not a fit
------
You know what else is funny?  Essentially no VC will pay for third party technical due diligence. They will place multi$M bets but won’t pay $10K to have actual subject matter expert take a deep dive on the tech first.

if you liked my Lex podcast, here's five links that shaped how I think. gems of a decaying internet. take some time on this Independence Day and read them.

AMD (unlike Qualcomm) is a joy to buy chips from. 7.38 PFLOPS of compute was delivered today, with exaflops more to come.

Nice to see them more active on the ROCm GitHub, we are working on the layer above

I'm offering due diligence as a service. Before you invest millions into an AI or hard tech startup, hire me for $10K. I will evaluate feasibility of idea and realisticness of timeline given founder.

Send money before reach out, PayPal geohot@gmail.com. Will refund if not a fit

You know what else is funny?  Essentially no VC will pay for third party technical due diligence. They will place multi$M bets but won’t pay $10K to have actual subject matter expert take a deep dive on the tech first.

one of the easiest policy wins i can imagine for the US is to reform high-skill immigration.

the fact that many of the most talented people in the world want to be here is a hard-won gift; embracing them is the key to keeping it that way.

Today we open-source a dataset of 100k heavily compressed driving videos for machine learning experiments. 

We included the encoder, the decoder, and the GPT model that generated the video below.

There are 2 challenges with $500 reward each.

Today we open-source a dataset of 100k heavily compressed driving videos for machine learning experiments. 

We included the encoder, the decoder, and the GPT model that generated the video below.

There are 2 challenges with $500 reward each.

A ResNet-50 in tinygrad with DEBUG=2
It uses 61 GPU kernels.

Color coding of dimensions:
Blue/Cyan: global/local (block/thread)

Purple: reduce (unrolled) 
Yellow: upcasted

AMD (unlike Qualcomm) is a joy to buy chips from. 7.38 PFLOPS of compute was delivered today, with exaflops more to come.

Nice to see them more active on the ROCm GitHub, we are working on the layer above

You know what else is funny?  Essentially no VC will pay for third party technical due diligence. They will place multi$M bets but won’t pay $10K to have actual subject matter expert take a deep dive on the tech first.

we may not agree on many things, but this is one of the easiest changes the US can make that radically brightens our potential future.

one of the easiest policy wins i can imagine for the US is to reform high-skill immigration.

the fact that many of the most talented people in the world want to be here is a hard-won gift; embracing them is the key to keeping it that way.

Today we open-source a dataset of 100k heavily compressed driving videos for machine learning experiments. 

We included the encoder, the decoder, and the GPT model that generated the video below.

There are 2 challenges with $500 reward each.
https://github.com/commaai/commavq
------
A ResNet-50 in tinygrad with DEBUG=2
It uses 61 GPU kernels.

Color coding of dimensions:
Blue/Cyan: global/local (block/thread)
Red: reduce (loop)
Purple: reduce (unrolled) 
Yellow: upcasted
------
A good intro to the tiny corp for people who want to come work here.

Also the tiny corp is back on the "get AMD on MLPerf plan". Spoke with 
@LisaSu
, I do believe things will get better and AMD will begin to develop in public. 

1) Help out by doing bounties! $1,000 for finishing up the RDNA3 assembler
2) Preorder a tinybox

https://tinygrad.org
------
AMD (unlike Qualcomm) is a joy to buy chips from. 7.38 PFLOPS of compute was delivered today, with exaflops more to come.

Nice to see them more active on the ROCm GitHub, we are working on the layer above

Today we open-source a dataset of 100k heavily compressed driving videos for machine learning experiments. 

We included the encoder, the decoder, and the GPT model that generated the video below.

There are 2 challenges with $500 reward each.

A ResNet-50 in tinygrad with DEBUG=2
It uses 61 GPU kernels.

Color coding of dimensions:
Blue/Cyan: global/local (block/thread)
Red: reduce (loop)
Purple: reduce (unrolled) 
Yellow: upcasted

A good intro to the tiny corp for people who want to come work here.

Also the tiny corp is back on the "get AMD on MLPerf plan". Spoke with 
@LisaSu
, I do believe things will get better and AMD will begin to develop in public. 

1) Help out by doing bounties! $1,000 for finishing up the RDNA3 assembler
2) Preorder a tinybox

------
AMD (unlike Qualcomm) is a joy to buy chips from. 7.38 PFLOPS of compute was delivered today, with exaflops more to come.

Nice to see them more active on the ROCm GitHub, we are working on the layer above

What have you done to make the blue line go up today?

Our ML simulation is getting better. This video is entirely imagined by a neural network.

I'm offering due diligence as a service. Before you invest millions into an AI or hard tech startup, hire me for $10K. I will evaluate feasibility of idea and realisticness of timeline given founder.

Send money before reach out, PayPal geohot@gmail.com. Will refund if not a fit
------
You know what else is funny?  Essentially no VC will pay for third party technical due diligence. They will place multi$M bets but won’t pay $10K to have actual subject matter expert take a deep dive on the tech first.

we may not agree on many things, but this is one of the easiest changes the US can make that radically brightens our potential future.

it's literally free money for our country. and I don't know about you, but I like living in a rich country with smart people.

one of the easiest policy wins i can imagine for the US is to reform high-skill immigration.

the fact that many of the most talented people in the world want to be here is a hard-won gift; embracing them is the key to keeping it that way.

hard to get this back if we lose it.

Is there a difference between the AI control problem and the human control problem? And if you are (still) here for the drama, I talk about my Twitter internship.

we may not agree on many things, but this is one of the easiest changes the US can make that radically brightens our potential future.

it's literally free money for our country. and I don't know about you, but I like living in a rich country with smart people.

one of the easiest policy wins i can imagine for the US is to reform high-skill immigration.

the fact that many of the most talented people in the world want to be here is a hard-won gift; embracing them is the key to keeping it that way.

hard to get this back if we lose it.

Today we open-source a dataset of 100k heavily compressed driving videos for machine learning experiments. 

We included the encoder, the decoder, and the GPT model that generated the video below.

There are 2 challenges with $500 reward each.

A ResNet-50 in tinygrad with DEBUG=2
It uses 61 GPU kernels.

Color coding of dimensions:
Blue/Cyan: global/local (block/thread)
Red: reduce (loop)
Purple: reduce (unrolled) 
Yellow: upcasted

A good intro to the tiny corp for people who want to come work here.

Also the tiny corp is back on the "get AMD on MLPerf plan". Spoke with 
@LisaSu
, I do believe things will get better and AMD will begin to develop in public. 

1) Help out by doing bounties! $1,000 for finishing up the RDNA3 assembler
2) Preorder a tinybox

https://tinygrad.org
------
AMD (unlike Qualcomm) is a joy to buy chips from. 7.38 PFLOPS of compute was delivered today, with exaflops more to come.

Nice to see them more active on the ROCm GitHub, we are working on the layer above

we may not agree on many things, but this is one of the easiest changes the US can make that radically brightens our potential future.

it's literally free money for our country. and I don't know about you, but I like living in a rich country with smart people.

one of the easiest policy wins i can imagine for the US is to reform high-skill immigration.

the fact that many of the most talented people in the world want to be here is a hard-won gift; embracing them is the key to keeping it that way.

hard to get this back if we lose it.

Is there a difference between the AI control problem and the human control problem? And if you are (still) here for the drama, I talk about my Twitter internship.

Today we open-source a dataset of 100k heavily compressed driving videos for machine learning experiments. 

We included the encoder, the decoder, and the GPT model that generated the video below.

There are 2 challenges with $500 reward each.
https://github.com/commaai/commavq
------
A ResNet-50 in tinygrad with DEBUG=2
It uses 61 GPU kernels.

Color coding of dimensions:
Blue/Cyan: global/local (block/thread)
Red: reduce (loop)
Purple: reduce (unrolled) 
Yellow: upcasted
------
A good intro to the tiny corp for people who want to come work here.

Also the tiny corp is back on the "get AMD on MLPerf plan". Spoke with 
@LisaSu
, I do believe things will get better and AMD will begin to develop in public. 

1) Help out by doing bounties! $1,000 for finishing up the RDNA3 assembler
2) Preorder a tinybox

https://tinygrad.org
------
AMD (unlike Qualcomm) is a joy to buy chips from. 7.38 PFLOPS of compute was delivered today, with exaflops more to come.

Nice to see them more active on the ROCm GitHub, we are working on the layer above

tinybox in a living room, vaporwave, volumetric light, octane render, hyperrealistic

What have you done to make the blue line go up today?
------
Our ML simulation is getting better. This video is entirely imagined by a neural network.
------
I'm offering due diligence as a service. Before you invest millions into an AI or hard tech startup, hire me for $10K. I will evaluate feasibility of idea and realisticness of timeline given founder.

Send money before reach out, PayPal geohot@gmail.com. Will refund if not a fit
------
You know what else is funny?  Essentially no VC will pay for third party technical due diligence. They will place multi$M bets but won’t pay $10K to have actual subject matter expert take a deep dive on the tech first.

if you liked my Lex podcast, here's five links that shaped how I think. gems of a decaying internet. take some time on this Independence Day and read them.

AMD (unlike Qualcomm) is a joy to buy chips from. 7.38 PFLOPS of compute was delivered today, with exaflops more to come.

Nice to see them more active on the ROCm GitHub, we are working on the layer above

I'm offering due diligence as a service. Before you invest millions into an AI or hard tech startup, hire me for $10K. I will evaluate feasibility of idea and realisticness of timeline given founder.

Send money before reach out, PayPal geohot@gmail.com. Will refund if not a fit

You know what else is funny?  Essentially no VC will pay for third party technical due diligence. They will place multi$M bets but won’t pay $10K to have actual subject matter expert take a deep dive on the tech first.

one of the easiest policy wins i can imagine for the US is to reform high-skill immigration.

the fact that many of the most talented people in the world want to be here is a hard-won gift; embracing them is the key to keeping it that way.

Today we open-source a dataset of 100k heavily compressed driving videos for machine learning experiments. 

We included the encoder, the decoder, and the GPT model that generated the video below.

There are 2 challenges with $500 reward each.

Today we open-source a dataset of 100k heavily compressed driving videos for machine learning experiments. 

We included the encoder, the decoder, and the GPT model that generated the video below.

There are 2 challenges with $500 reward each.

A ResNet-50 in tinygrad with DEBUG=2
It uses 61 GPU kernels.

Color coding of dimensions:
Blue/Cyan: global/local (block/thread)

Purple: reduce (unrolled) 
Yellow: upcasted

AMD (unlike Qualcomm) is a joy to buy chips from. 7.38 PFLOPS of compute was delivered today, with exaflops more to come.

Nice to see them more active on the ROCm GitHub, we are working on the layer above

You know what else is funny?  Essentially no VC will pay for third party technical due diligence. They will place multi$M bets but won’t pay $10K to have actual subject matter expert take a deep dive on the tech first.

What have you done to make the blue line go up today?

Our ML simulation is getting better. This video is entirely imagined by a neural network.

I'm offering due diligence as a service. Before you invest millions into an AI or hard tech startup, hire me for $10K. I will evaluate feasibility of idea and realisticness of timeline given founder.

Send money before reach out, PayPal geohot@gmail.com. Will refund if not a fit
------
You know what else is funny?  Essentially no VC will pay for third party technical due diligence. They will place multi$M bets but won’t pay $10K to have actual subject matter expert take a deep dive on the tech first.

if you liked my Lex podcast, here's five links that shaped how I think. gems of a decaying internet. take some time on this Independence Day and read them.

we may not agree on many things, but this is one of the easiest changes the US can make that radically brightens our potential future.

it's literally free money for our country. and I don't know about you, but I like living in a rich country with smart people.
------
one of the easiest policy wins i can imagine for the US is to reform high-skill immigration.

the fact that many of the most talented people in the world want to be here is a hard-won gift; embracing them is the key to keeping it that way.

hard to get this back if we lose it.

Is there a difference between the AI control problem and the human control problem? And if you are (still) here for the drama, I talk about my Twitter internship.

After these new 15 minutes of fame are over and I return to the twitterless shadow realm, if you'd like to follow the tiny corp: 
@__tinygrad__


Our mission is "to commoditize the petaflop"

When the overlords come for your compute, don't get caught lackin.

Today we open-source a dataset of 100k heavily compressed driving videos for machine learning experiments. 

We included the encoder, the decoder, and the GPT model that generated the video below.

There are 2 challenges with $500 reward each.

A ResNet-50 in tinygrad with DEBUG=2
It uses 61 GPU kernels.

Color coding of dimensions:
Blue/Cyan: global/local (block/thread)
Red: reduce (loop)
Purple: reduce (unrolled) 
Yellow: upcasted
------
A good intro to the tiny corp for people who want to come work here.

Also the tiny corp is back on the "get AMD on MLPerf plan". Spoke with 
@LisaSu
, I do believe things will get better and AMD will begin to develop in public. 

1) Help out by doing bounties! $1,000 for finishing up the RDNA3 assembler
2) Preorder a tinybox
