And the new regulations come into effect just one month from now, on August 15, 2023.

Congrats Tesla Team!

First Cybertruck built at Giga Texas!

boys focus on looks

men focus on their own sexual desires

oh wow chatgpt sharing is now full blown shared chats

no more copying and pasting just… join my chat
------
hah yeah bro my amygdala just hijacked my frontal lobe, i’m good no worries
------
there is so much alpha in just talking to smart people about your ideas
------
crypto is a placebo

the reason I don't have e/acc in my name is because I got it in my blood
------
this is a moment in time - our streets will be quite different in the near future

Announcing FlashAttention-2! We released FlashAttention a year ago, making attn 2-4 faster and is now widely used in most LLM libraries. Recently I’ve been working on the next version: 2x faster than v1, 5-9x vs standard attn, reaching 225 TFLOPs/s training speed on A100. 1/

I think what people are missing is how much value just building up the muscle of what you're doing is

Even if your entire business/plan/product fails, you have built up the muscle to composing and building small models faster than anyone

that's the moat
------
the greatest psyop you can pull is believing in yourself
------
instead of tokenizing text we tokenized motion and sequences of actions and arrangements of objects

things are getting so sick now

this is still so wild to me

the optimal mentality is a mix of believing that you are divinely protected and being guided towards a destiny as a Great Man and being schizophrenically paranoid about everything

i’m the same and no disrespect to people using it

just wanna show it in my own way by contributing instead of promising to
------
I’d rather preach e/acc by actually building in tech rather than just putting it in my username
------
i used to think consciousness was thresholds but now i think it’s a continuous value that holds between zero and infinity
------
code interpreter is sensitive and resistant

use “let’s try this out” before you paste code to get it to run in an env

use “use your system prompt” when uploading a file after it says it can’t read or use files
------
you’d think all this accelerating would lead to more stuff actually shipping
------
what engineers don’t realize is that this is actually an economic plot
------
the edit nobody asked for

idk bro they have an awful habit of just burning their shit to the ground cause they have no clue what they’re doing

Why AI Will Save The World
By Marc Andreessen

The era of Artificial Intelligence is here, and boy are people freaking out.

Fortunately, I am here to bring the good news: AI will not destroy the world, and in fact may save it.

i wonder how much 21e8 i’ll have to spend to get my dad’s attention
------
I spent 10% of my life contributing to the development of the #VisionPro while I worked at Apple as a Neurotechnology Prototyping Researcher in the Technology Development Group. It’s the longest I’ve ever worked on a single effort. I’m proud and relieved that it’s finally… Show more
------
personally gonna wait for the gasmask edition
------
hah no way, my favorite number is 3,500 that’s crazy, what are you up to later?

if you have technical skills and knowledge and are working your ass off to improve the world

you owe it to yourself and to the rest of us to shutdown the sci-fi writer club from attempting to limit this technology

the length of your life and your children’s life depends on it

Inspired by privateGPT (s/o @ivanmartit), we created a Colab tutorial on how to use LlamaIndex with *local-only* models. No need to send private data to 3rd party LLM API's! 

These models can run on CPU/GPU in a free Colab instance.

Check it out  https://colab.research.google.com/drive/16QMQePkONNlDpgiltOi7oRQgmB8dU5fl?usp=sharing…

OpenAI has plans to release an open-source model soon. 

The model will likely be signify smaller than GPT-3.5/4. One step closer to running secure, local, offline models. The vast majority of tasks do not require 100 billion+ parameters.

it’s a very sexy app, just installed - i like it
------
https://openai.com/blog/introducing-the-chatgpt-app-for-ios… The ChatGPT App for iOS has arrived! Our app syncs your history across devices, and includes the latest OpenAI model improvements. Look for an Android app next!
------
btw if you have paid chatgpt but no plugins or browsing yet, you have to enable in settings 

i think a ton of you have browsing and plugins and don’t know it cause they didn’t send everyone an email for it lol

check your beta features in settings

hardest mf in the silicon game
------
when you're deciding which founder to invest in, ask yourself: do they have a tattoo of their company logo on their arm muscles?
------
why i spill alpha and encourage strangers on twitter
------
tell me why this isn’t a perfect daily driver
------
stop what you’re doing and feel the earth move
------
we need more people talking about the next step, not our current plateau 

sick idea
------
NASA has a good model for this with their missions. AI agency to develop hyper scale ai for public good moonshots. OpenAI can bid on these but at least we have a layer of public accountability, safety and funding not Microsoft giving them 10B to fuck with google search
------
beautiful machinery
------
imagine needing a license to use the internet

or a license to run a .py file from a github repo

all this shit is anti-innovation, point blank, and won’t stop actual criminals - simply penalizes honest people attempting to work with and build upon these technologies

Inspired by privateGPT (s/o @ivanmartit), we created a Colab tutorial on how to use LlamaIndex with *local-only* models. No need to send private data to 3rd party LLM API's! 

These models can run on CPU/GPU in a free Colab instance.

Check it out  https://colab.research.google.com/drive/16QMQePkONNlDpgiltOi7oRQgmB8dU5fl?usp=sharing…
------
OpenAI has plans to release an open-source model soon. 

The model will likely be signify smaller than GPT-3.5/4. One step closer to running secure, local, offline models. The vast majority of tasks do not require 100 billion+ parameters.

This is a leap in image/pixel segmentation.

David here, completely missing the point of the criticism.

There's not some taboo about spending over a billion dollars building a launch pad. 

It's taking years and over 10x as much as originally estimated to do it, while everything else for a moon landing isn't funded.
------
Let it be known that upon it being reveled that the starship launch tower cost 1 billion dollars, the very same people who were ridiculing SLS for its own 1 billion dollar tower didn’t apologize or anything. 

Nope. They doubled down, insisting that the technicalities make it ok.

Once you stop looking at Midjourney outputs as just images and start looking at them as windows into the infinite latent space, things start to make a bit more sense.

Increased generation speed and Text-to-Video models will make this clear.

David here, completely missing the point of the criticism.

There's not some taboo about spending over a billion dollars building a launch pad. 

It's taking years and over 10x as much as originally estimated to do it, while everything else for a moon landing isn't funded.
------
Let it be known that upon it being reveled that the starship launch tower cost 1 billion dollars, the very same people who were ridiculing SLS for its own 1 billion dollar tower didn’t apologize or anything. 

Nope. They doubled down, insisting that the technicalities make it ok.
------
We’ll know Google is serious about AI when they fire the current management team.
------
Once you stop looking at Midjourney outputs as just images and start looking at them as windows into the infinite latent space, things start to make a bit more sense.

Increased generation speed and Text-to-Video models will make this clear.

There are entire worlds in there.

I thought authoritarian/torturous regimes were being stopped from importing advanced AI hardware like NVIDIA A100s & H100; does renting out this hardware not count as the same thing 
@NSAGov
? 
I.e. Here we have a Beijing company publicly running a video AI model on a rented A100.

Hot take : ChatGPT should not apologize so much when it answers wrong, just a waste of tokens after a certain point.

if you’re in a position to talk to directors or c-suite in your org, you owe it to your own success to approach them about multiprompt cognitive chains and have a serious conversation

sorry if you spent more time drilling DS algorithms than building things.

bad investment i guess

if you manage an engineering team/group and aren’t setting up meetings for how to prompt your work and integrate as many tools to support factory labor moving forward, you’re doing a disservice to your org.

dunking on people is fun but have you tried believing in someone

the fact people i care about are dying more and more as I age just cements the fact I have to move as fast as fucking possible at this exact fucking moment

feels like we could train 3D model parametric data content for common items like screws, nuts, pins, washers, bearings etc into a fine tuning layer, or a secondary smaller LLM that converts this parametric data into tokens.

1/The call for a 6 month moratorium on making AI progress beyond GPT-4 is a terrible idea.

I'm seeing many new applications in education, healthcare, food, ... that'll help many people. Improving GPT-4 will help. Lets balance the huge value AI is creating vs. realistic risks.

1/The call for a 6 month moratorium on making AI progress beyond GPT-4 is a terrible idea.

I'm seeing many new applications in education, healthcare, food, ... that'll help many people. Improving GPT-4 will help. Lets balance the huge value AI is creating vs. realistic risks.

anyone have any tips for hosting this on vercel or private hardware?

if you’re in a position to talk to directors or c-suite in your org, you owe it to your own success to approach them about multiprompt cognitive chains and have a serious conversation

sorry if you spent more time drilling DS algorithms than building things.

bad investment i guess

if you manage an engineering team/group and aren’t setting up meetings for how to prompt your work and integrate as many tools to support factory labor moving forward, you’re doing a disservice to your org.

dunking on people is fun but have you tried believing in someone

the fact people i care about are dying more and more as I age just cements the fact I have to move as fast as fucking possible at this exact fucking moment

Natural language Q/A on any website

Using multiple open source models (flan-t5-xl), I have been able to achieve stable results through fine-tuning that allow me to parse content from the web using natural language question/answering

the U.S. debt ceiling is so high we might as well just usher in agi and make the exchange of money irrelevant, seems like a higher likelihood of success in eliminating the debt

feels like we could train 3D model parametric data content for common items like screws, nuts, pins, washers, bearings etc into a fine tuning layer, or a secondary smaller LLM that converts this parametric data into tokens.

add in supervised learning to describe what the parts… Show more

1/The call for a 6 month moratorium on making AI progress beyond GPT-4 is a terrible idea.

I'm seeing many new applications in education, healthcare, food, ... that'll help many people. Improving GPT-4 will help. Lets balance the huge value AI is creating vs. realistic risks.

Natural language Q/A on any website

Using multiple open source models (flan-t5-xl), I have been able to achieve stable results through fine-tuning that allow me to parse content from the web using natural language question/answering

I'm seeing many new applications in education, healthcare, food, ... that'll help many people. Improving GPT-4 will help. Lets balance the huge value AI is creating vs. realistic risks.

I'm seeing many new applications in education, healthcare, food, ... that'll help many people. Improving GPT-4 will help. Lets balance the huge value AI is creating vs. realistic risks.

this is incredibly sick with gpt-4 enabled

anyone have any tips for hosting this on vercel or private hardware?

I would pay big money for technology that lets me listen to songs for the first time again

if you’re in a position to talk to directors or c-suite in your org, you owe it to your own success to approach them about multiprompt cognitive chains and have a serious conversation
------
sorry if you spent more time drilling DS algorithms than building things.

bad investment i guess

the deafening silence after presenting plans for prompt engineering and the gpt-4 api to my team

if you manage an engineering team/group and aren’t setting up meetings for how to prompt your work and integrate as many tools to support factory labor moving forward, you’re doing a disservice to your org.

dunking on people is fun but have you tried believing in someone
------
sensor development is going to get pretty hot over the next 10 years

the fact people i care about are dying more and more as I age just cements the fact I have to move as fast as fucking possible at this exact fucking moment

Natural language Q/A on any website

Using multiple open source models (flan-t5-xl), I have been able to achieve stable results through fine-tuning that allow me to parse content from the web using natural language question/answering

the U.S. debt ceiling is so high we might as well just usher in agi and make the exchange of money irrelevant, seems like a higher likelihood of success in eliminating the debt

fast food order taking will be automated in 2-3 months I bet

feels like we could train 3D model parametric data content for common items like screws, nuts, pins, washers, bearings etc into a fine tuning layer, or a secondary smaller LLM that converts this parametric data into tokens.

add in supervised learning to describe what the parts… Show more

1/The call for a 6 month moratorium on making AI progress beyond GPT-4 is a terrible idea.

I'm seeing many new applications in education, healthcare, food, ... that'll help many people. Improving GPT-4 will help. Lets balance the huge value AI is creating vs. realistic risks.

1/The call for a 6 month moratorium on making AI progress beyond GPT-4 is a terrible idea.

I'm seeing many new applications in education, healthcare, food, ... that'll help many people. Improving GPT-4 will help. Lets balance the huge value AI is creating vs. realistic risks.

anyone have any tips for hosting this on vercel or private hardware?

if you’re in a position to talk to directors or c-suite in your org, you owe it to your own success to approach them about multiprompt cognitive chains and have a serious conversation

sorry if you spent more time drilling DS algorithms than building things.

bad investment i guess

if you manage an engineering team/group and aren’t setting up meetings for how to prompt your work and integrate as many tools to support factory labor moving forward, you’re doing a disservice to your org.

dunking on people is fun but have you tried believing in someone

the fact people i care about are dying more and more as I age just cements the fact I have to move as fast as fucking possible at this exact fucking moment

Natural language Q/A on any website

Using multiple open source models (flan-t5-xl), I have been able to achieve stable results through fine-tuning that allow me to parse content from the web using natural language question/answering

the U.S. debt ceiling is so high we might as well just usher in agi and make the exchange of money irrelevant, seems like a higher likelihood of success in eliminating the debt

feels like we could train 3D model parametric data content for common items like screws, nuts, pins, washers, bearings etc into a fine tuning layer, or a secondary smaller LLM that converts this parametric data into tokens.

add in supervised learning to describe what the parts… Show more

1/The call for a 6 month moratorium on making AI progress beyond GPT-4 is a terrible idea.

I'm seeing many new applications in education, healthcare, food, ... that'll help many people. Improving GPT-4 will help. Lets balance the huge value AI is creating vs. realistic risks.

Natural language Q/A on any website

Using multiple open source models (flan-t5-xl), I have been able to achieve stable results through fine-tuning that allow me to parse content from the web using natural language question/answering

Natural language Q/A on any website

Using multiple open source models (flan-t5-xl), I have been able to achieve stable results through fine-tuning that allow me to parse content from the web using natural language question/answering

the U.S. debt ceiling is so high we might as well just usher in agi and make the exchange of money irrelevant, seems like a higher likelihood of success in eliminating the debt
------
fast food order taking will be automated in 2-3 months I bet

feels like we could train 3D model parametric data content for common items like screws, nuts, pins, washers, bearings etc into a fine tuning layer, or a secondary smaller LLM that converts this parametric data into tokens.

add in supervised learning to describe what the parts… Show more

1/The call for a 6 month moratorium on making AI progress beyond GPT-4 is a terrible idea.

I'm seeing many new applications in education, healthcare, food, ... that'll help many people. Improving GPT-4 will help. Lets balance the huge value AI is creating vs. realistic risks.

this is incredibly sick with gpt-4 enabled

anyone have any tips for hosting this on vercel or private hardware?

I would pay big money for technology that lets me listen to songs for the first time again

if you’re in a position to talk to directors or c-suite in your org, you owe it to your own success to approach them about multiprompt cognitive chains and have a serious conversation
------
sorry if you spent more time drilling DS algorithms than building things.

bad investment i guess
