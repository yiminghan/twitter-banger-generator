Take a moment to appreciate the magic of trade. A free trade is when two parties make an exchange because they both want to, and both wind up better off. Yes, fraud, coercion, and externalities exist, but the vast majority of exchanges are unregretted and positive sum.

If you never risk being wrong you'll never beat the risk-free rate of return.

Always being correct through caution isn't as powerful as synthesizing data at-speed and course correcting.  

Move fast and break things, even established theories of physics.

mf trained a simple model to translate ada-002 embeddings back to text and found something interesting:

sentence embeddings have arithmetic properties

the classic "king - man + woman = queen" still works just like w/ token embeddings — but can go a few steps beyond that as well

Parcel K is a nice area where people hang out and have ice cream and whatever. meanwhile 3 blocks away is this mostly empty parking lot in front of the worst mural I’ve ever seen. you’ll never see the city officials clamoring to build something here though

neurosurgeons with 30 years of experience making around 900k seems perfectly reasonable, there’s a reason why the US has the best neurosurgery in the world
------
we should increase the supply of doctors
------
“we can import a million developing world neurosurgeons” there’s a reason why the truly wealthy in india will still fly to the Mayo Clinic to get treated
------
“they are working too long and not at their best” this is like a midwit business column advice. having a few people working longer is better than more working 30 hours a week. switching surgeons in the middle of a long surgery is terrible for patient outcomes
------
Women’s skin in 2023 is arguably the best it’s ever been. Men’s too. Even with no cosmetic surgery, a 40 year old today looks much younger than a 40 year old in 1980. Why do people keep saying this lol
------
you cannot tell me that the reason half of these women have shitty skin well into their adult years and need a "skin routine" is because of these gross ass makeup products twitter.com/cctvidiots/sta…

Sometimes you’ll feel like you’re winning a debate with a safetyist and then you get hit with the “okay but did you see this?” And they link a LessWrong post called consanguineal resonance or something and your whole word falls apart

Technology is accelerating
------
we all know that’s not even where the money is going. a neurosurgeon probably does like 5-15 surgeries a week each of which costs like 50 grand sticker price. the value is not accumulating to the neurosurgeon

Does anyone work anymore?

Went on a walk Monday at 11:00 am and there were young people everywhere.

Working age people.

Between all these 'creator' types, remote work, quiet quitting, etc...

I honestly wonder how many people even work anymore.

Is your city like that?

First independent measurement of zero resistance in LK-99 

A team of scientists from the Physics Department of Southeast University, a top university in Nanjing, China, have reported measuring 0 resistance in a sample of LK-99 they synthesized from scratch.

RT-2: “[Vision-language models] take […] images as input, and [produce] tokens that, conventionally, represent natural language text. […] To control a robot, [we represent] actions as tokens in the model’s output […].”

“There is nothing outside the text.” — Jacques Derrida
------
Today, we announced 𝗥𝗧-𝟮: a first of its kind vision-language-action model to control robots. 

It learns from both web and robotics data and translates this knowledge into generalised instructions.

it’s a popular 80s/90s hippie Berkeley academic argument to say that we’re on the verge of nuclear extinction or whatever. the reality is that atomic weapons ended war and full scale nuclear exchange is not possible
------
nuclear weapons created the pax atomica americana, thanks to mr j robert oppenheimer

also i dont believe anthropics apply. nuclear winter is fake and the exchange wouldn’t cause our extinction. there would be unthinkable loss and chaos as every major city turns to ash, but the fukuyama take is that it would only set us back like ~200 years

Me: "GPT with Code Interpreter Here is a 1,000 years of data on England. Identify the exact year the Industrial Revolution started."

some people have a flawed model of LMs where they think the outputs are somehow cursed or valueless. that their thinking is fake, their creativity is fake and pollutes the mind of the reader and any downstream models trained on that data. not true. good thinking always has value

As this part of anon tech Twitter grows it's important to decompose your follower growth into alpha and beta. This is pretty easy, just use roons follower count as the market index, and measure your followers as a % of roon.

Most historical fiction misleads us into thinking that past folk were more like us than they actually were. If you understood how weird was the past, you'd know roughly how weird of a future to expect.
------
To critics and movie-goers I would simply say - the world was weird. IS weird, if you dare to travel beyond the confines of your provincial backyard or your Lonely Planet travel-guide.

Things seeming strange, even "absurd" to you does NOT mean they were not done.

when i was 22 i was all gung-ho about getting rid of the medical licensing board and 10xing the number of doctors but at this ripe age i realize they already accept too many people who can’t tell left from right

everywhere people look for conspiracy to explain the deficits of the world because it reads as better storytelling to us but all there is is a lack of technical ability, a bedrock of very difficult real world problem, miracles that need to be worked

The huge decrease in cancer deaths looks like the result of a lot of scientific and medical research paying off over time, not a single breakthrough.
------
"Crude five year breast cancer mortality risk was 14.4% (95% confidence interval 14.2% to 14.6%) for women with a diagnosis made during 1993-99 and 4.9% (4.8% to 5.0%) for women with a diagnosis made during 2010-15."

Pretty big drop.

The argument that the internet didn't impact GDP much because we've kept to a ~1.5% yearly per capita growth trend since 1990 seems weak to me. Perhaps without the internet, we would have had 0.5% yearly growth instead. How can you infer the counterfactual from the trend?

People laughed at Kurzweil but in retrospect his whole thing was more empirical + coherent than much current AI discourse, and he's basically right re: things getting progressively weirder + speeding up due in large part to exponential trends in compute.

I keep revisiting this great paper from 
@andy_l_jones
: “Scaling scaling laws with board games”. It shows how training compute and inference compute of MCTS can be traded off against each other. 10x more MCTS steps is almost the same as training 10x more. https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.03113

Large language models change everything for linguistics, starting with Chomsky.

Featuring: LLMs as scientific theories, response to prior takes, "why" questions in language, acquisition... and how the field should have seen this coming.

optimization is enough to build language intelligence, but that doesn’t refute the fact that humans have been optimized by revolution for a million years to acquire language and we do it like it’s nothing

In a great (& destructive) irony, Mechanical Turk is just AI, now.

The MTurk crowdworking platform is a major place for researchers (and companies) to get humans to do small tasks & experiments. But this paper finds 33-46% of Turkers use LLMs to do tasks. https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07899

Of course, if this AlphaDev result really was a one line register optimization, the reviewers would tell us, wouldn't they? After all, that’s why we pay them the big publication fees. It’s their job.

ChatGPT as a tool for city government:
------
one thing that’s funny is that language models are baseline pretty liberal. if you play with alpaca or vicuna or whatever open source stuff they’re going to be way more liberal than ChatGPT etc
------
that’s because the open internet of “authoritative sources” clearly veers liberal. you have to fine tune LLMs to be “unbiased”
------
much of the job of fine tuning is to over time get these things to be less preachy and refuse fewer requests rather than what everyone seems to think “brain damaging it for compliance reasons”

there is a huge gain to be made by every company on the planet by just running every file in their codebase through gpt4 with the prompt "what's wrong with this?"

GPT-4 "discovered" the same sorting algorithm as AlphaDev by removing "mov S P".

No RL needed. Can I publish this on nature?

Sorting algorithm underpins all critical softwares. DeepMind's AlphaDev speeds up sorting small sequences (3-5 items) by 70%.

Key takeaways:
