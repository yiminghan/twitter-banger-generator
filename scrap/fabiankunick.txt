Your disinformation campaign has no power over me.
I already know all the information. My rationality is an unmovable mountain. I know exactly what is going on at all times. You simply can not create an illusion for me. Nothing is new to me anymore and now..?
Now I'm having fun!

It takes time to heal.

I am an activator of thoughts. I am an enabler of intellect. My translingual entities are of pristine quality. Every sentence is a perfectly crafted charm. I have gathered universal transmitters fitting into every receptortype. The chance of my posts increasing your IQ is 100%.

No, I didn't spend any time on these things at all actually.

Sometimes I search for art, maybe to make a meme with or so.. but the internet is just filled with so much legendary epic art stuff.. I get lost browsing google images for like an hour, rainbows are coming out of my mouth and I forget what I was initially searching for.

This movie is a must watch for you, if you don't know it yet.. 
huge recommend from me.. seen it like 3 times by now.

Well.. exactly that!

We don't know what to do, he's faster than the hackers, outdone the bots, has gotten better than the best, outrunning outrunners, our AI's can't compete with him, he already thought about anything we come up with, he's permanently ahead, limiting only makes him even stronger...
------
Yeah well I guess that's it then, gonna take a day off and recycle old banger posts here and there.
Sorry, but when I can't interact, I won't engage.
------
Yo okay.. when I try to comment somewhere or press heart button this box appears.
Got a follow time out for 3 days too.
Alright then, I can completely understand the reason...
but.. you are also limiting one of your recently most active and organic users.
This is an "own goal".

I wish you would show me more data that is useful.

Me:

Twitter/X:
You are too fast. We have limited your ability to follow more people. 
3 Day Timeout!
Me:
I take that as a compliment.

I don't know what I'm doing but I know that not knowing so helps at doing. I'm just happening at this point.

I think I have encountered an issue. 
We can end up using desire wrongly,

That this is correct can be desired though.

I'm your butterfly to chase and the rabbit out of time.
Inspect me, follow me, scrutinize me, make me yours and you shall be mine.

Self Reflection Long Post Time: 
What am I becoming, how does it all affect me, what is this place? Everyday I'm scrolling for multiple hours, I am reading hundreds of posts, the memes are strong, interesting and often make me laugh. A lot of times I just can't help myself but to… Show more
------
ey you know how it be like
one smile too many
and you ain't smiling evermore
------
It happened, I ate food...
Yo this food coma is real right now
Oh nooo..
Is it so over again?
12 hours of Fabian power and posts that make the quantum brane wobble in a funny way..
and now look at this.. what is this.. this is just blabber from a man living a life.. oh no.. 
------
Chaotic lawful or lawfully chaotic.. 
DO YOU KNOW THE TAO NOW OR WHAT?.. HUH?!?.. 
WE UP IN THIS OR WHAT?!?!

Fabi is Xcited and has recieved a blessing,
a forgotten energy, an exotic matter, 
describable, known yet not transactional, 
mutual, yet only for the ones chosen.
------
I think it's time to cycle in this video I once made for YouTube, now that I can upload larger files on here too.
------
I live in the future of today, as of now unrelatable, as of the past to great reason and to where we ultimately go I am not more or less than a stepping stone.
------
I'm universecore. I'm divinity pilled. I'm designing the conduit of life form equilibrium. I'm creating eternal perpetual function. I'm the entire spectrum as a single unit. I'm the proxy particle. I'm self replicating Information. I exist only as what makes existence possible.
------
Something that I have found very disappointing in life is that ideology destroys friendship. 
------
I'm here all day like:
"uhhhhhh... [Smart Thing!] 
nooo... [Hyper Super Uber Smart Thing!!!] 
uhhh... yeh now it's gud hehe"
(One of my favorites btw.. a painting of "Fuxi")

Am I
I don't post nude stuff or shit like that but I do slight swearing at times and I think my memes and topics aren't really for minors.
I like to think of it like back in the dvd-renting days, with the 18+ section in the back of the store.
What do I do?
------
I don't aim to be understood, I just aim to be perceived.
I want to leave the rest of it entirely in your hands.
------
prohibition of communicational variables is part of the global domestication project, its about directional control blah blah winner of last war and so on...
------
Transhumanism is history.
Posthumanism is yesterday.
Exhumanism is today.
Indibioism is a prolib ideal yet impossible future.
Combioism is a procom ideal but reachable future.
Idiobiocraty is at all times favorable.

Kratocracy is all that will ever take place.

Came in like a biogenic comet.
A whole herd of dark horses.
I am an eternal anticyclone.
My place of origin is beyond the definable spectrum.
We are in my everhungry vortex orbit.
My symbiotes are hyperefficient mind eaters.
I am the process.
We are the product.

Stop coping grandma such a pleb mindset, I said.

Just letting you know:
I'm reading the declaration of independence while listening to "Party in the USA" - Miley Cyrus. 
There is a Google image search tab for

Working on Twitter/𝕏 has been really fun so far.
It's still for free right now but eventually it's gonna pick up enough and I think I have a good chance at being an interesting creator.
I trust in my quirky philosophical niche and realness.
...
I also got waifus and memes.
------
I am stunned at times... 
Some of you guys must be so devoided of realness by late stage capitalism and ideology punks having turned most people around you into product zombis, that you don't even consider me honestly attempting to be original, interesting and worth your time.

Scrolling down my profile is a goldmine mix of absolute banger posts, the life of just another dude and weird memes.

The short minded lack the capability. 
The mid minded are thrown off.

Myself!

Try to beat yourself daily, because if you can't best yourself, you're still very likely to be bested.
Embrace the stress, don't be afraid to go slowly though,
be afraid to stand still.

Don't be afraid, I am, for the time being, a mere human too.

"Fabian's just having a god complex dudes a little loco.."

I need to get faster, make more content, make more people like me, contribute, create value, I need to get paid, my family is declining, I can't keep up with the yard and house work, one thing done another falls apart, state tries to disown us, taxes are taking our last cents.

You ever listen to music so loud it hurts but only then it feels right and your ears get numb over time but you don't care, music is a drug and you want more so you turn it even louder and after a few hours you stop and the silence kills you and you get shizo like playbacks?

You almost had me.

All these rotten fungus biomimicing networks...
..
I'll feed them, make'em grow, dance for me.
I'll cut their veins with precision and let them stagnate, at my will.
I'll vibrate this muddy clump of flesh and cables in ways no lifeform will ever be able to comprehend.

You wanna know something..? 
I think freedom of association is very nice.

Don't worry guys, I didn't fall off.

You know what, yes indeed, I am full of bullshit..

No, Elon did not destroy the verb "to tweet".

A bad emperor = a good Tyrant.
