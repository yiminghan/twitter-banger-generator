I should disclose that I’m far from an ai person. Could have made a lot of money on the grift but chose to focus on other things. Was pretty neutral on it

If a Google product is good at launch, they don’t see reason to improve it, so they let it stagnate and die

If a Google product isn’t good at launch, they add new features until it dies under their weight

During my Amazon internship, I got Linux and i3 pilled really hard.

2 years later at my first real job, my manager used a Mac with all apps full screen. Just CMD+tab’d through it all. Fastest dev I’d ever seen.

Since the Apple Silicon transition, the one thing I have a tough time calling Macs is overpriced

Seriously, they just arent now. To find a comparable Windows laptop in every aspect, performance battery display speakers camera microphone build etc it'll cost you more than a Mac

m1 and m2 MacBook’s are fantastic for MOST majors in college. good performance with great battery life will be fine for most. 

that being said they’re shit for mostly everything else and macOS is ass. and yeah hella overpriced, but that’s the apple experience. I’ll never get one

Nobody talks about how a $1,000,000 mortgage costs you $1,217,160 in interest payments ON TOP of the $1,000,000 in loan payments on a house

You pay $2,217,160 to borrow $1,000,000!

If someone commits a crime, & we can prove it, I will vigorously prosecute the case every time. The Bonham & Nelson case in connection to a suspected carjacking is very complex. My office discharged this case because more investigation is required to properly charge this case.

I used to think that E2E tests >>> unit tests.

Now I think most unit tests are useless and most E2E tests are redundant.

What's useful IMO:
 Unit tests that test core units of biz logic

And you don't need to write that many tests!

Please don't rank frameworks by how big the dev binaries are. Use `pnpm` and you'll download them like once ever. They don't affect your users.

Heard about this new JS framework called T3 and decided to watch a video on YT.   

Five minutes in:  

"And now you need to set up Vercel, Prisma, PlanetScale, tRPC, hydration, SSGHelper..."

Who needs this complexity?

Temporarily moving all of my subdomains to http://t3.wtf, please use that if you're looking for any of our shit

Some good news - my audio issues are probably *finally* over for recording

Just did my first test with this guy and I’m annoyed by how absurdly clean it is
------
Feels like the universe took this tweet as a challenge

Feels like things are finally calming down. Last two months have been rough but man I'm excited for what's coming

What domain TLDs have caused you issues? Filming a video about it

Update: the registrar likely hates PO Boxes.

Do NOT use .gg or .io if you don’t have to. This is insanity. 
------
Hey @vercel friends, all the stuff on my t3 domain is down and I have no idea why. Help pls.
------
No, I was not warned. Neither was Vercel.

I don’t even want to think about all the emails I’ve lost forever from this…

I'm back! I'm thrilled to announce that I've rejoined the @reactjs team! Huge thank you to @Eli_White @dan_abramov and @sethwebster for all their work to give me the chance to come back to the team

- All seems fine in the Vercel dash
- I filled out the info for all my .gg domains a month ago
- my other .gg domains are all fine

This drive has TERRIBLE reliability and has taken years off my life.

On May 14 2017, TWiLight Menu++ was released on GitHub, allowing for DS game backups to be played without use of a game cartridge.

Still can’t believe how great 
@OpenSauceLive
 was. Legit the best conference I’ve been to.

Every detail was planned alarmingly well. Creators were supported at EVERY step.

I hope 
@WilliamOsman
 and the team have enough time to chill and be proud of what they’ve made here

As far as I’m concerned, the bar for creator-focused conferences has been raised in a massive way. The future is bright.

Thank you for letting me be a small part in the chaos

I’m not going to pretend I know what going through a mental health crisis feels like.

However, out of all the people that I have met online, Dan was my closest friend and the one I talked to the most. We had plans of attending conferences and streaming together, and I even… Show more

I was introduced to Dan Jutan when he posted that he was searching for SolidJS docs help. It was my first big “role” within tech, even if it wasn’t huge and i was excited.

Dan has been an active danger to the safety of myself and close friends for months. For him, this screenshot is tame.

1Password 2fa is more secure than whatever shitty 2fa App you’re using now and it works via browser extension. It’s so much better AND safer. Just use it.

Had multiple people confirm the only way to add 2fa to bw is with the phone app camera which is really stupid IMO https://twitter.com/t3dotgg/status/1678154660950192129?s=46&t=UvyVXF6GNB9_Oufc5Z3HQg…

The amount of straight up misinfo in the replies here has me 100% confident in my 1Password recommendation. If you think your solution is better, there’s a high chance it is worse. Please just use 1pass.

Or I guess use Bitwarden if you hate good ux.

For those who wonder why I’m pushing RSCs so hard - this “omg” moment hit me even harder

There's probably still good reasons to write app shell / SPA type web apps. Offline support is a big one.

Obviously re-writing an SPA just for RSC would be insane.

But holy shit for everything else ... I don't ever want to go back. 

This is so good.

Just realized the only reason I get so many “You’re just a shill!” comments:

They have no other argument.

I feel stupid for not realizing this earlier.

All "you're paid to say this" comments are a perma-ban on my channel now.

At least this guy has something to say

1Password 2fa is more secure than whatever shitty 2fa App you’re using now and it works via browser extension. It’s so much better AND safer. Just use it.
------
Use 1Password twitter.com/adamdotdev/sta…
------
If you come here to shill BitWarden in a thread about 2fa support when theirs is utter shit, reconsider
------
Had multiple people confirm the only way to add 2fa to bw is with the phone app camera which is really stupid IMO https://twitter.com/t3dotgg/status/1678154660950192129?s=46&t=UvyVXF6GNB9_Oufc5Z3HQg…
------
The amount of straight up misinfo in the replies here has me 100% confident in my 1Password recommendation. If you think your solution is better, there’s a high chance it is worse. Please just use 1pass.

Or I guess use Bitwarden if you hate good ux.

@npmjs
 finally responded to my report about this saying that they reviewed the case and decided not to act. I guess their package squatting policy is a lie  Not sure how else to interpret such a response.

Hey @npmjs @github  This person has been squatting on a hundred packages for years: https://npmjs.com/~mtso

Can you free them up?

I'd love to use "use-menu" but it's just a dead, empty package.

------
also i’m obviously speaking from my own personal perspective. the react party line is we’re working on it yada yada. because we are. non-heckin-stop. but my personal feeling is that this attitude and climate will eventually burn people out one by one. no future is assured

BREAKING: Twitter now BLOCKS ALL ACCESS FROM SIGNED OUT USERS

More views does not mean more value.

Crazy thought: Anyone want to be a "youtube thumbnail intern"?

Role expectations:
- Help brainstorm thumbnail ideas
- Help draft early versions of thumbnails
- Tell me if ideas are bad/dumb
- Manage the assets we use for thumbnails

Would 100% be down to pay if actually helpful

Fwiw, I 100% believe that Mr Beast could ghostwrite a channel to 20m+ view vids in half a year. Would be surprised if it took him more than 3 months tbh

Why is this so hard to believe? I consistently make 20+ mil bangers on my side channels (that even without me would still bang) and it wouldn’t be that crazy to do on a new channel

Virality is a skill that can be honed, I know most don’t agree but it is. (I also don’t care that… Show more

IMO this is the exact definition of FUD. It may hold some water for framework authors, but as an app dev it is not aligned with reality.

IMO, App Router should probably throw an error if a client component is async. These behaviors are so hard to debug and a little too easy to trigger

Remember a few months ago when I discovered async client components?

Turns out they exist, they're not stable, they're not at all documented, but they're in the regular react release branch and ...

IMO this is the exact definition of FUD. It may hold some water for framework authors, but as an app dev it is not aligned with reality.

Fear - instability
Uncertainty - lack of docs
Doubt - "to call any of this stable and safe for production is detached..."

I'm sorry but anyone calling this take FUD (cough @t3dotgg cough) is wrong.

Made custom authentication pages for @ClerkDev.

Stole the o-auth stuffs from @jullerino acme corp. The clerk doc is pretty cool.

So cool seeing the pipe from my dumb examples -> create-t3-app -> create-t3-turbo -> acme-corp -> an actually good demo

Our Lyft driver just fully picked up the wrong person. They got like half a mile before I called the driver.

I wonder if they would have made it all the way to Mountain View (we’re in sf)

My round 1 in melee doubles played like this I have never been more scared in my life

Holy shit my AWS video is now my third most viewed

Tbh I'm shocked how many of y'all were using Google Domains

To be clear - I don't get why any PROGRAMMER would use it. Seems like a lot of people liked recommending it to non-devs, didn't know that was a thing but I believe y'all

Any friends with a Rodecaster Pro 2 down to do some tests for me? Want to confirm some behaviors that might be specific to my unit (or apartment)

Confirmed there is noise on an empty XLR port at 60+db 

Thought I was going insane, relieved but also annoyed. SM7B benefits a lot from going over 60. Gonna try some external preamps to see how it compares

The most critical piece of advice I can give to streamers right now is to build a secondary platform for monetization and discovery. 

No matter if you stay on Twitch or want to switch, the suggestion is going to be the same: start a YouTube channel.

I will never use one of these hellish cables to charge my Mac. I’m on my 2nd MagSafe-ready machine and have still only charged with USB-C

Seems to work but … is it ok?

So much MagSafe cope in the replies. They took away a useful port (TB4) to give me:
- a power-only jack with a proprietary connector
- an SD card slot that takes 3 tries to work
- an HDMI port that refuses to output 1440p

Have you ever had a tough time convincing someone to adopt React Native?

In this #ChainReact2023 talk, 
@t3dotgg
 proposes a new model for how we deal with "complexity" as we build.

The 350 sub minimum is a $10.5k/year barrier for entry. This program only applies for people >$10k and <$100k a year in Twitch sub revenue. I really don’t get the minimums here

Made a list of small potential Ws for Twitch, mostly to show what could be done to win back sentiment. These ideas are focused around two core goals: show creators they’re cared for and incentivize/reward the people growing the platform.

So these new MacBooks come with this bullshit for a power cord. Is it still safe to plug in an “old-school” (ie few years ago) usb-c power cord? 

Seems to work but … is it ok?

So much MagSafe cope in the replies. They took away a useful port (TB4) to give me:
- a power-only jack with a proprietary connector
- an SD card slot that takes 3 tries to work
- an HDMI port that refuses to output 1440p

uploadthing by @t3dotgg is so underrated.

It takes care of all the annoying parts like presigned urls, validation, etc.

Just implemented the image upload feature for my Tweet Editor and the backend part took like 5mins

Fascinating. This feels…upside down?

The 350 sub minimum is a $10.5k/year barrier for entry. This program only applies for people >$10k and <$100k a year in Twitch sub revenue. I really don’t get the minimums here

Funny enough I proposed almost the exact opposite, giving better splits (100%) but ONLY to your first 100 subscribers

Made a list of small potential Ws for Twitch, mostly to show what could be done to win back sentiment. These ideas are focused around two core goals: show creators they’re cared for and incentivize/reward the people growing the platform.

Here are all the numbers and behind-the-scenes of the launch...

I will never use one of these hellish cables to charge my Mac. I’m on my 2nd MagSafe-ready machine and have still only charged with USB-C
------
So these new MacBooks come with this bullshit for a power cord. Is it still safe to plug in an “old-school” (ie few years ago) usb-c power cord? 

Seems to work but … is it ok?
------
So much MagSafe cope in the replies. They took away a useful port (TB4) to give me:
- a power-only jack with a proprietary connector
- an SD card slot that takes 3 tries to work
- an HDMI port that refuses to output 1440p

…y’all are the problem
------
Why is everyone so mad about Lightning but so cool with this? I’ll never understand the users Apple is bending to with these decisions

Ever build an app just to learn it only works in Node 20+ because it relies on `File`, and then learn none of the polyfills work, and then suddenly it's 4am?

Fascinating. This feels…upside down?

The 350 sub minimum is a $10.5k/year barrier for entry. This program only applies for people >$10k and <$100k a year in Twitch sub revenue. I really don’t get the minimums here

Funny enough I proposed almost the exact opposite, giving better splits (100%) but ONLY to your first 100 subscribers

Made a list of small potential Ws for Twitch, mostly to show what could be done to win back sentiment. These ideas are focused around two core goals: show creators they’re cared for and incentivize/reward the people growing the platform.

I just wanna thank every single person who shared, liked, and upvoted during the http://resend.com launch.

Here are all the numbers and behind-the-scenes of the launch...

I will never use one of these hellish cables to charge my Mac. I’m on my 2nd MagSafe-ready machine and have still only charged with USB-C
------
So these new MacBooks come with this bullshit for a power cord. Is it still safe to plug in an “old-school” (ie few years ago) usb-c power cord? 

Seems to work but … is it ok?
------
So much MagSafe cope in the replies. They took away a useful port (TB4) to give me:
- a power-only jack with a proprietary connector
- an SD card slot that takes 3 tries to work
- an HDMI port that refuses to output 1440p

…y’all are the problem
------
Why is everyone so mad about Lightning but so cool with this? I’ll never understand the users Apple is bending to with these decisions
------
Ever build an app just to learn it only works in Node 20+ because it relies on `File`, and then learn none of the polyfills work, and then suddenly it's 4am?

...just me?

Funny enough I proposed almost the exact opposite, giving better splits (100%) but ONLY to your first 100 subscribers
------
Made a list of small potential Ws for Twitch, mostly to show what could be done to win back sentiment. These ideas are focused around two core goals: show creators they’re cared for and incentivize/reward the people growing the platform.

- 100% rev on first 100 subscribers

I’ll just say it: pirating Windows made me a better programmer

I'll just say it: owning windows makes me a better programmer twitter.com/dabit3/status/…
------
Let’s see if we can beat this with one video 
------
I just wanna thank every single person who shared, liked, and upvoted during the http://resend.com launch.

Here are all the numbers and behind-the-scenes of the launch...
------
I will never use one of these hellish cables to charge my Mac. I’m on my 2nd MagSafe-ready machine and have still only charged with USB-C
------
So these new MacBooks come with this bullshit for a power cord. Is it still safe to plug in an “old-school” (ie few years ago) usb-c power cord? 

Seems to work but … is it ok?
------
So much MagSafe cope in the replies. They took away a useful port (TB4) to give me:
- a power-only jack with a proprietary connector
- an SD card slot that takes 3 tries to work
- an HDMI port that refuses to output 1440p

…y’all are the problem
------
Why is everyone so mad about Lightning but so cool with this? I’ll never understand the users Apple is bending to with these decisions
------
Ever build an app just to learn it only works in Node 20+ because it relies on `File`, and then learn none of the polyfills work, and then suddenly it's 4am?

...just me?
------
Github repo if anyone wants to try and figure it out

Added server-side sorting, filtering, and pagination with @DrizzleOrm. Using @shadcn sheet, slider, and checkboxes for filtering.

uploadthing by @t3dotgg is so underrated.

It takes care of all the annoying parts like presigned urls, validation, etc.

Just implemented the image upload feature for my Tweet Editor and the backend part took like 5mins

Fascinating. This feels…upside down?

The 350 sub minimum is a $10.5k/year barrier for entry. This program only applies for people >$10k and <$100k a year in Twitch sub revenue. I really don’t get the minimums here

Here are all the numbers and behind-the-scenes of the launch...

I will never use one of these hellish cables to charge my Mac. I’m on my 2nd MagSafe-ready machine and have still only charged with USB-C
------
So these new MacBooks come with this bullshit for a power cord. Is it still safe to plug in an “old-school” (ie few years ago) usb-c power cord? 

Seems to work but … is it ok?
------
So much MagSafe cope in the replies. They took away a useful port (TB4) to give me:
- a power-only jack with a proprietary connector
- an SD card slot that takes 3 tries to work
- an HDMI port that refuses to output 1440p

…y’all are the problem
------
Why is everyone so mad about Lightning but so cool with this? I’ll never understand the users Apple is bending to with these decisions
------
Ever build an app just to learn it only works in Node 20+ because it relies on `File`, and then learn none of the polyfills work, and then suddenly it's 4am?

...just me?

Fascinating. This feels…upside down?

The 350 sub minimum is a $10.5k/year barrier for entry. This program only applies for people >$10k and <$100k a year in Twitch sub revenue. I really don’t get the minimums here

Funny enough I proposed almost the exact opposite, giving better splits (100%) but ONLY to your first 100 subscribers

Made a list of small potential Ws for Twitch, mostly to show what could be done to win back sentiment. These ideas are focused around two core goals: show creators they’re cared for and incentivize/reward the people growing the platform.

So these new MacBooks come with this bullshit for a power cord. Is it still safe to plug in an “old-school” (ie few years ago) usb-c power cord?

Fascinating. This feels…upside down?

The 350 sub minimum is a $10.5k/year barrier for entry. This program only applies for people >$10k and <$100k a year in Twitch sub revenue. I really don’t get the minimums here

uploadthing by @t3dotgg is so underrated.

It takes care of all the annoying parts like presigned urls, validation, etc.

Fascinating. This feels…upside down?

The 350 sub minimum is a $10.5k/year barrier for entry. This program only applies for people >$10k and <$100k a year in Twitch sub revenue. I really don’t get the minimums here

Funny enough I proposed almost the exact opposite, giving better splits (100%) but ONLY to your first 100 subscribers

Made a list of small potential Ws for Twitch, mostly to show what could be done to win back sentiment. These ideas are focused around two core goals: show creators they’re cared for and incentivize/reward the people growing the platform.

I will never use one of these hellish cables to charge my Mac. I’m on my 2nd MagSafe-ready machine and have still only charged with USB-C
------
So these new MacBooks come with this bullshit for a power cord. Is it still safe to plug in an “old-school” (ie few years ago) usb-c power cord? 

Seems to work but … is it ok?
------
So much MagSafe cope in the replies. They took away a useful port (TB4) to give me:
- a power-only jack with a proprietary connector
- an SD card slot that takes 3 tries to work
- an HDMI port that refuses to output 1440p

uploadthing by @t3dotgg is so underrated.

It takes care of all the annoying parts like presigned urls, validation, etc.

Just implemented the image upload feature for my Tweet Editor and the backend part took like 5mins

Fascinating. This feels…upside down?

The 350 sub minimum is a $10.5k/year barrier for entry. This program only applies for people >$10k and <$100k a year in Twitch sub revenue. I really don’t get the minimums here

Funny enough I proposed almost the exact opposite, giving better splits (100%) but ONLY to your first 100 subscribers

Made a list of small potential Ws for Twitch, mostly to show what could be done to win back sentiment. These ideas are focused around two core goals: show creators they’re cared for and incentivize/reward the people growing the platform.

I just wanna thank every single person who shared, liked, and upvoted during the http://resend.com launch.

Here are all the numbers and behind-the-scenes of the launch...

I will never use one of these hellish cables to charge my Mac. I’m on my 2nd MagSafe-ready machine and have still only charged with USB-C
------
So these new MacBooks come with this bullshit for a power cord. Is it still safe to plug in an “old-school” (ie few years ago) usb-c power cord? 

Seems to work but … is it ok?
------
So much MagSafe cope in the replies. They took away a useful port (TB4) to give me:
- a power-only jack with a proprietary connector
- an SD card slot that takes 3 tries to work
- an HDMI port that refuses to output 1440p

…y’all are the problem
------
Why is everyone so mad about Lightning but so cool with this? I’ll never understand the users Apple is bending to with these decisions
------
Ever build an app just to learn it only works in Node 20+ because it relies on `File`, and then learn none of the polyfills work, and then suddenly it's 4am?

...just me?

Fascinating. This feels…upside down?

The 350 sub minimum is a $10.5k/year barrier for entry. This program only applies for people >$10k and <$100k a year in Twitch sub revenue. I really don’t get the minimums here

Today, Twitch is announcing the Twitch Partner Plus program.

Funny enough I proposed almost the exact opposite, giving better splits (100%) but ONLY to your first 100 subscribers
------
Made a list of small potential Ws for Twitch, mostly to show what could be done to win back sentiment. These ideas are focused around two core goals: show creators they’re cared for and incentivize/reward the people growing the platform.

I’ll just say it: pirating Windows made me a better programmer

I'll just say it: owning windows makes me a better programmer twitter.com/dabit3/status/…

Let’s see if we can beat this with one video

I just wanna thank every single person who shared, liked, and upvoted during the http://resend.com launch.

Here are all the numbers and behind-the-scenes of the launch...
------
I will never use one of these hellish cables to charge my Mac. I’m on my 2nd MagSafe-ready machine and have still only charged with USB-C
------
So these new MacBooks come with this bullshit for a power cord. Is it still safe to plug in an “old-school” (ie few years ago) usb-c power cord? 

Seems to work but … is it ok?
------
So much MagSafe cope in the replies. They took away a useful port (TB4) to give me:
- a power-only jack with a proprietary connector
- an SD card slot that takes 3 tries to work
- an HDMI port that refuses to output 1440p

…y’all are the problem
------
Why is everyone so mad about Lightning but so cool with this? I’ll never understand the users Apple is bending to with these decisions
------
Ever build an app just to learn it only works in Node 20+ because it relies on `File`, and then learn none of the polyfills work, and then suddenly it's 4am?

...just me?

Github repo if anyone wants to try and figure it out

Added server-side sorting, filtering, and pagination with @DrizzleOrm. Using @shadcn sheet, slider, and checkboxes for filtering.

uploadthing by @t3dotgg is so underrated.

It takes care of all the annoying parts like presigned urls, validation, etc.

Just implemented the image upload feature for my Tweet Editor and the backend part took like 5mins

I will never use one of these hellish cables to charge my Mac. I’m on my 2nd MagSafe-ready machine and have still only charged with USB-C
------
So these new MacBooks come with this bullshit for a power cord. Is it still safe to plug in an “old-school” (ie few years ago) usb-c power cord? 

Seems to work but … is it ok?
------

- an SD card slot that takes 3 tries to work
- an HDMI port that refuses to output 1440p

…y’all are the problem
------
Why is everyone so mad about Lightning but so cool with this? I’ll never understand the users Apple is bending to with these decisions
------
Ever build an app just to learn it only works in Node 20+ because it relies on `File`, and then learn none of the polyfills work, and then suddenly it's 4am?

...just me?

Fascinating. This feels…upside down?

The 350 sub minimum is a $10.5k/year barrier for entry. This program only applies for people >$10k and <$100k a year in Twitch sub revenue. I really don’t get the minimums here

Here are all the numbers and behind-the-scenes of the launch...

I will never use one of these hellish cables to charge my Mac. I’m on my 2nd MagSafe-ready machine and have still only charged with USB-C
------
So these new MacBooks come with this bullshit for a power cord. Is it still safe to plug in an “old-school” (ie few years ago) usb-c power cord? 

Seems to work but … is it ok?
------
So much MagSafe cope in the replies. They took away a useful port (TB4) to give me:

Fascinating. This feels…upside down?

The 350 sub minimum is a $10.5k/year barrier for entry. This program only applies for people >$10k and <$100k a year in Twitch sub revenue. I really don’t get the minimums here

Made a list of small potential Ws for Twitch, mostly to show what could be done to win back sentiment. These ideas are focused around two core goals: show creators they’re cared for and incentivize/reward the people growing the platform.

Ever build an app just to learn it only works in Node 20+ because it relies on `File`, and then learn none of the polyfills work, and then suddenly it's 4am?

Fascinating. This feels…upside down?

The 350 sub minimum is a $10.5k/year barrier for entry. This program only applies for people >$10k and <$100k a year in Twitch sub revenue. I really don’t get the minimums here

Funny enough I proposed almost the exact opposite, giving better splits (100%) but ONLY to your first 100 subscribers

uploadthing by @t3dotgg is so underrated.

It takes care of all the annoying parts like presigned urls, validation, etc.

Just implemented the image upload feature for my Tweet Editor and the backend part took like 5mins

Fascinating. This feels…upside down?

The 350 sub minimum is a $10.5k/year barrier for entry. This program only applies for people >$10k and <$100k a year in Twitch sub revenue. I really don’t get the minimums here

Funny enough I proposed almost the exact opposite, giving better splits (100%) but ONLY to your first 100 subscribers

Made a list of small potential Ws for Twitch, mostly to show what could be done to win back sentiment. These ideas are focused around two core goals: show creators they’re cared for and incentivize/reward the people growing the platform.

I just wanna thank every single person who shared, liked, and upvoted during the http://resend.com launch.

Here are all the numbers and behind-the-scenes of the launch...

I will never use one of these hellish cables to charge my Mac. I’m on my 2nd MagSafe-ready machine and have still only charged with USB-C
------
So these new MacBooks come with this bullshit for a power cord. Is it still safe to plug in an “old-school” (ie few years ago) usb-c power cord? 

Seems to work but … is it ok?
------
So much MagSafe cope in the replies. They took away a useful port (TB4) to give me:
- a power-only jack with a proprietary connector
- an SD card slot that takes 3 tries to work
- an HDMI port that refuses to output 1440p

…y’all are the problem
------
Why is everyone so mad about Lightning but so cool with this? I’ll never understand the users Apple is bending to with these decisions
------
Ever build an app just to learn it only works in Node 20+ because it relies on `File`, and then learn none of the polyfills work, and then suddenly it's 4am?

...just me?

Fascinating. This feels…upside down?

The 350 sub minimum is a $10.5k/year barrier for entry. This program only applies for people >$10k and <$100k a year in Twitch sub revenue. I really don’t get the minimums here

Funny enough I proposed almost the exact opposite, giving better splits (100%) but ONLY to your first 100 subscribers

Made a list of small potential Ws for Twitch, mostly to show what could be done to win back sentiment. These ideas are focused around two core goals: show creators they’re cared for and incentivize/reward the people growing the platform.

I just wanna thank every single person who shared, liked, and upvoted during the http://resend.com launch.

Here are all the numbers and behind-the-scenes of the launch...

I will never use one of these hellish cables to charge my Mac. I’m on my 2nd MagSafe-ready machine and have still only charged with USB-C
------
So these new MacBooks come with this bullshit for a power cord. Is it still safe to plug in an “old-school” (ie few years ago) usb-c power cord? 

Seems to work but … is it ok?
------
So much MagSafe cope in the replies. They took away a useful port (TB4) to give me:
- a power-only jack with a proprietary connector
- an SD card slot that takes 3 tries to work
- an HDMI port that refuses to output 1440p

…y’all are the problem
------
Why is everyone so mad about Lightning but so cool with this? I’ll never understand the users Apple is bending to with these decisions
------
Ever build an app just to learn it only works in Node 20+ because it relies on `File`, and then learn none of the polyfills work, and then suddenly it's 4am?

...just me?

Funny enough I proposed almost the exact opposite, giving better splits (100%) but ONLY to your first 100 subscribers
------
Made a list of small potential Ws for Twitch, mostly to show what could be done to win back sentiment. These ideas are focused around two core goals: show creators they’re cared for and incentivize/reward the people growing the platform.

- 100% rev on first 100 subscribers

I’ll just say it: pirating Windows made me a better programmer

I'll just say it: owning windows makes me a better programmer twitter.com/dabit3/status/…
------
Let’s see if we can beat this with one video 
------
I just wanna thank every single person who shared, liked, and upvoted during the http://resend.com launch.

Here are all the numbers and behind-the-scenes of the launch...
------
I will never use one of these hellish cables to charge my Mac. I’m on my 2nd MagSafe-ready machine and have still only charged with USB-C
------
So these new MacBooks come with this bullshit for a power cord. Is it still safe to plug in an “old-school” (ie few years ago) usb-c power cord? 

Seems to work but … is it ok?
------
So much MagSafe cope in the replies. They took away a useful port (TB4) to give me:
- a power-only jack with a proprietary connector
- an SD card slot that takes 3 tries to work
- an HDMI port that refuses to output 1440p

…y’all are the problem
------
Why is everyone so mad about Lightning but so cool with this? I’ll never understand the users Apple is bending to with these decisions
------
Ever build an app just to learn it only works in Node 20+ because it relies on `File`, and then learn none of the polyfills work, and then suddenly it's 4am?

...just me?
------
Github repo if anyone wants to try and figure it out

Added server-side sorting, filtering, and pagination with @DrizzleOrm. Using @shadcn sheet, slider, and checkboxes for filtering.

uploadthing by @t3dotgg is so underrated.

It takes care of all the annoying parts like presigned urls, validation, etc.

Just implemented the image upload feature for my Tweet Editor and the backend part took like 5mins

Fascinating. This feels…upside down?

The 350 sub minimum is a $10.5k/year barrier for entry. This program only applies for people >$10k and <$100k a year in Twitch sub revenue. I really don’t get the minimums here

Here are all the numbers and behind-the-scenes of the launch...

I will never use one of these hellish cables to charge my Mac. I’m on my 2nd MagSafe-ready machine and have still only charged with USB-C
------
So these new MacBooks come with this bullshit for a power cord. Is it still safe to plug in an “old-school” (ie few years ago) usb-c power cord? 

Seems to work but … is it ok?
------
So much MagSafe cope in the replies. They took away a useful port (TB4) to give me:
- a power-only jack with a proprietary connector
- an SD card slot that takes 3 tries to work
- an HDMI port that refuses to output 1440p

…y’all are the problem
------
Why is everyone so mad about Lightning but so cool with this? I’ll never understand the users Apple is bending to with these decisions
------
Ever build an app just to learn it only works in Node 20+ because it relies on `File`, and then learn none of the polyfills work, and then suddenly it's 4am?

...just me?

Fascinating. This feels…upside down?

The 350 sub minimum is a $10.5k/year barrier for entry. This program only applies for people >$10k and <$100k a year in Twitch sub revenue. I really don’t get the minimums here

Funny enough I proposed almost the exact opposite, giving better splits (100%) but ONLY to your first 100 subscribers

Made a list of small potential Ws for Twitch, mostly to show what could be done to win back sentiment. These ideas are focused around two core goals: show creators they’re cared for and incentivize/reward the people growing the platform.

So these new MacBooks come with this bullshit for a power cord. Is it still safe to plug in an “old-school” (ie few years ago) usb-c power cord? 

Seems to work but … is it ok?
