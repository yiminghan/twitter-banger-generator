I invited 
@growing_daniel
 on my podcast and he agreed

After hours of prep he canceled day-of hours before recording

He asked to reschedule and then ghosted me

Paying me to be a retard online is 100x more impactful than going to mars
------
$TSLA WILL TRIPLE BY JAN 2024 LIKE AND REPLY AND SCROLL ALL OF THE REPLIES MULTIPLE TIMES IF YOU AGREE
------
If you're preoccupied with building your career and loving your wife and kids then you seriously need to get your fucking life together and focus on getting impressions on x dot com
------
*finds out we only get paid for premium users impressions* uhhhhhh you're a fucking loser if you don't have a blue checkmark
------
I cannot be ratio'd. Try it. You cannot ratio this post
------
UMMM WAIT. DO WE JUST GET CHECKS THIS BIG EVERY MONTH
------
The first payout I thought was like, cumulative for the five months since Elon announced ad share. So I figured it'd be like $400 a month or so for an account my size/reach.

If it's actually $2-3k a month then that's a game changer.

if you dont want "fascism" actually the worst thing to do is to fail to perform the basic functions of a sovereign

In Japan if they find out you have weed they call in an airstrike. From the US navy (japan doesn’t have a military lol)

Weed smokers can kill without feeling. They do not have souls like you and me

The “game” being running on a track seems like a missed opportunity. I’m going to hire a game dev team and license Star Wars or something for a much cooler experience.

It’s the death of a culture when they start restricting smoking. Official sterilization

Talking to my therapist about the lizzo thing and she’s as dazed and confused as I am. At the end of my rope here

Wiggers get a lot of talk but the white guy who hangs out with nothing but black people without adopting any stereotypical mannerisms is under studied

First video of LK-99 Full Levitation, aka flux-pinning

This video was just posted to the Chinese video-sharing site BiliBili  and claims to be a highly pure synthesized sample of LK-99.

Small molecule oral cancer drug kills 100% of solid tumors across 70 evaluated cancer types in vitro and in animal models with a therapeutic index of 6 and no discernible side effects

Phase 1 trials now underway

Never mind it’s so over

This is very misleading. The drug was tested in 70 cell lines (data not included) and 3 mouse models of 3 types of solid tumors, with tumor shrinkage, but no adverse side effects. This isn’t metastatic cancer this isn’t humans, this is 3 solid tumors in mice.

Zaluzhny says current plans are not feasible, and simple math indicates why: Ukraine has recaptured ~50 square miles at a cost of over 10,000 lives. Since Russia occupies 50,000 sq miles (1000x), at this rate it will cost Ukraine 10,000,000 lives to liberate the entire country.
