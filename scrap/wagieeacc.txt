I'm trying to change that w/ my Podcast: "In the Arena"

Lambda and Coreweave do the same thing. But Lambda charges $1.89/hr list price while Coreweave charges $2.23/hr list price. If you need 1024 H100s with InfiniBand for 3 years, you'd save $9.1M by choosing Lambda.

The math and choice is simple: (2.23-1.89)*24*365*1024*3 = $9.1M

Why AI Will Save The World

The era of Artificial Intelligence is here, and boy are people freaking out.

Fortunately, I am here to bring the good news: AI will not destroy the world, and in fact may save it.

Fuck it, we just dropped our H100 on-demand prices to 1.99. From now on, Lambda will always have the cheapest price in the entire world, if we don't, just tweet at me and we will drop the price.

Single query + retriever + LLM answering can now be easily tackled. The real power of LLMs is in tackling complex open-domain QA that requires multi-step reasoning and planning.  IRCoT is an interesting approach to this form of QA. 1/

Over the weekend I made a funny little guy to explore the future of databases

What if instead of using SQL, or vector embeddings to do semantic search... we can just have LMs reason through each query?

What if LMs are all you need?

Here is our “slick” RLHF-alternative without RL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10425 (SLiC-HF)

TL;DR: Works as well as RLHF, but a lot simpler.

About as easy and efficient as fine-tuning. Much better than simply fine-tuning on good examples.

I'm a believer that LLMs need to evolve from being  Language models to being Knowledge models. (LKMs). To get there, they will need access to significant IP and data, the most important of which will not be free.  The question is which of the big 3 (Google/meta/msftopenai) will… Show more

Over the weekend I made a funny little guy to explore the future of databases

What if instead of using SQL, or vector embeddings to do semantic search... we can just have LMs reason through each query?

What if LMs are all you need?

Here is our “slick” RLHF-alternative without RL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10425 (SLiC-HF)

TL;DR: Works as well as RLHF, but a lot simpler.

About as easy and efficient as fine-tuning. Much better than simply fine-tuning on good examples.

What if LMs are all you need?

Here is our “slick” RLHF-alternative without RL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10425 (SLiC-HF)

TL;DR: Works as well as RLHF, but a lot simpler.

About as easy and efficient as fine-tuning. Much better than simply fine-tuning on good examples.

I'm a believer that LLMs need to evolve from being  Language models to being Knowledge models. (LKMs). To get there, they will need access to significant IP and data, the most important of which will not be free.  The question is which of the big 3 (Google/meta/msftopenai) will… Show more

Over the weekend I made a funny little guy to explore the future of databases

What if instead of using SQL, or vector embeddings to do semantic search... we can just have LMs reason through each query?

What if LMs are all you need?

Here is our “slick” RLHF-alternative without RL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10425 (SLiC-HF)

TL;DR: Works as well as RLHF, but a lot simpler.

About as easy and efficient as fine-tuning. Much better than simply fine-tuning on good examples.

TL;DR: Works as well as RLHF, but a lot simpler.

About as easy and efficient as fine-tuning. Much better than simply fine-tuning on good examples.

What if instead of using SQL, or vector embeddings to do semantic search... we can just have LMs reason through each query?

What if LMs are all you need?

Over the weekend I made a funny little guy to explore the future of databases

What if instead of using SQL, or vector embeddings to do semantic search... we can just have LMs reason through each query?

What if LMs are all you need?

Here is our “slick” RLHF-alternative without RL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10425 (SLiC-HF)

TL;DR: Works as well as RLHF, but a lot simpler.

About as easy and efficient as fine-tuning. Much better than simply fine-tuning on good examples.

What if instead of using SQL, or vector embeddings to do semantic search... we can just have LMs reason through each query?

What if LMs are all you need?

TL;DR: Works as well as RLHF, but a lot simpler.

About as easy and efficient as fine-tuning. Much better than simply fine-tuning on good examples.

What if instead of using SQL, or vector embeddings to do semantic search... we can just have LMs reason through each query?

What if LMs are all you need?

TL;DR: Works as well as RLHF, but a lot simpler.

About as easy and efficient as fine-tuning. Much better than simply fine-tuning on good examples.

I'm a believer that LLMs need to evolve from being  Language models to being Knowledge models. (LKMs). To get there, they will need access to significant IP and data, the most important of which will not be free.  The question is which of the big 3 (Google/meta/msftopenai) will… Show more

Over the weekend I made a funny little guy to explore the future of databases

What if instead of using SQL, or vector embeddings to do semantic search... we can just have LMs reason through each query?

What if LMs are all you need?

TL;DR: Works as well as RLHF, but a lot simpler.

About as easy and efficient as fine-tuning. Much better than simply fine-tuning on good examples.

Here is our “slick” RLHF-alternative without RL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10425 (SLiC-HF)

TL;DR: Works as well as RLHF, but a lot simpler.

About as easy and efficient as fine-tuning. Much better than simply fine-tuning on good examples.

What if instead of using SQL, or vector embeddings to do semantic search... we can just have LMs reason through each query?

What if LMs are all you need?

Over the weekend I made a funny little guy to explore the future of databases

What if instead of using SQL, or vector embeddings to do semantic search... we can just have LMs reason through each query?

What if LMs are all you need?

Here is our “slick” RLHF-alternative without RL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10425 (SLiC-HF)

TL;DR: Works as well as RLHF, but a lot simpler.

About as easy and efficient as fine-tuning. Much better than simply fine-tuning on good examples.

What if instead of using SQL, or vector embeddings to do semantic search... we can just have LMs reason through each query?

What if LMs are all you need?

Over the weekend I made a funny little guy to explore the future of databases

What if instead of using SQL, or vector embeddings to do semantic search... we can just have LMs reason through each query?

What if LMs are all you need?

Here is our “slick” RLHF-alternative without RL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10425 (SLiC-HF)

TL;DR: Works as well as RLHF, but a lot simpler.

About as easy and efficient as fine-tuning. Much better than simply fine-tuning on good examples.

What if instead of using SQL, or vector embeddings to do semantic search... we can just have LMs reason through each query?

What if LMs are all you need?

TL;DR: Works as well as RLHF, but a lot simpler.

About as easy and efficient as fine-tuning. Much better than simply fine-tuning on good examples.

What if instead of using SQL, or vector embeddings to do semantic search... we can just have LMs reason through each query?

What if LMs are all you need?

TL;DR: Works as well as RLHF, but a lot simpler.

About as easy and efficient as fine-tuning. Much better than simply fine-tuning on good examples.

I'm a believer that LLMs need to evolve from being  Language models to being Knowledge models. (LKMs). To get there, they will need access to significant IP and data, the most important of which will not be free.  The question is which of the big 3 (Google/meta/msftopenai) will… Show more

Over the weekend I made a funny little guy to explore the future of databases

What if instead of using SQL, or vector embeddings to do semantic search... we can just have LMs reason through each query?

What if LMs are all you need?

TL;DR: Works as well as RLHF, but a lot simpler.

About as easy and efficient as fine-tuning. Much better than simply fine-tuning on good examples.

Here is our “slick” RLHF-alternative without RL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10425 (SLiC-HF)

TL;DR: Works as well as RLHF, but a lot simpler.

About as easy and efficient as fine-tuning. Much better than simply fine-tuning on good examples.

What if instead of using SQL, or vector embeddings to do semantic search... we can just have LMs reason through each query?

What if LMs are all you need?

I'm a believer that LLMs need to evolve from being  Language models to being Knowledge models. (LKMs). To get there, they will need access to significant IP and data, the most important of which will not be free.  The question is which of the big 3 (Google/meta/msftopenai) will… Show more

Over the weekend I made a funny little guy to explore the future of databases

What if instead of using SQL, or vector embeddings to do semantic search... we can just have LMs reason through each query?

What if LMs are all you need?

Entropy disproportionately affects minorities and historically disadvantaged folx. I'm calling for Entropy Credits for a more sustainable thermodynamic future

Here is our “slick” RLHF-alternative without RL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10425 (SLiC-HF)

TL;DR: Works as well as RLHF, but a lot simpler.

About as easy and efficient as fine-tuning. Much better than simply fine-tuning on good examples.

From great collaborators:

The true star of RLHF is F=feedback. You may not need RL and you may not need humans.
