There is nothing more exciting than watching a neural network learn! Its alive!!!

Now imagine if you could write notes for bookmarked tweets.

I take back every bad thing I've ever sad about Elon Musk
------
So many good points made at the AI ethics side that are being ruined by a certain person’s obsession with starting a race war

what if someone livestreamed a replication of this proof the day the news reporters came out with it
------
dumb politicians who ignore economics say that they’ll give people money AND lower the price of goods; and the worst part is that they’ll always win
------
What’s so funny about all this to me is what i found so upsetting in graduate school: we’ve known how to stop recessions since the 1940s, the people in charge of doing so usually just find it morally distasteful to do what is necessary to stop them (Give People Money). twitter.com/jdcmedlock/sta…

replicable, maybe with a stability in government guaranteed by cold war allowing such a risky decision to be made without being jumped on by political enemies? maybe with a system that doesn’t need to psyop about the immigrants or the gays to keep being elected?

Has there been a more impressive large-scale energy transition than France in the 1970s and '80s?

this is why i’m committing to get a drivers license
------
you see the 'declining percentage of teenagers getting their driver's licenses' statistics trotted out every now and then, over the last ten years, as a routine story.

the real reason for this is almost never laid out. taking your driving test involves:

1. taking someone else's… Show more
------
fuck anxiety, and fuck my parents who’ll probably scold me for driving because it’s not safe and i should just let them drive me all the time

guys it’s real

damn i’m unoriginal noooo

Time for LK-99.cpp
------
Yeah that’s the part no one’s talking about. Humanities classes have all the freeloaders.
------
i had to take so many arts and crafts classes but no matter what level they were easy As, pure GPA booster for me; i was actually surprised by the lack of engagement by kids who were in the major those classes were part of! totally unmotivated 99% of the time twitter.com/KeiferReloaded…

someone really needs to study cai withdrawal symptoms this is gonna be a big problem in the future

Stability changed the name of these models to "Stable Beluga 1/2" and quietly removed the sentence of the blog post that mentioned they used two unnamed LLMs to generate their dataset. (This likely means they used OpenAI models, in clear violation of ToS)

cant we put a supercomputer to simulate that thing

maybe this even a misdirection?

from high school i was always being taught to “check the sources and authors” but never actually been taught the techniques how to do that. 

perhaps why we just end up skipping that step over and over

Based on science fiction, we’d think AI responds to cool logic. Instead, AI picks up on emotion. It clearly isn’t sentient or feeling, but acts that way.

is it impossible to figure out math education systematically and empirically, or are we just afraid of the results we’ll find by doing so?

it’s an open secret that “llm safety training” isn’t actually for people’s safety but instead for company’s protection from liability - a future llm will not be able understand this, because it’s unspoken

Too many AI startups are building for the world that exists now instead of the world that will exist in 3-5+ years.

The coolest thing I've been doing with generative AI recently is having it act as a narrator for bespoke "interactive" fiction games. I'm trying to work on integrating the GPT-4 APi with a read/write vector DB that can track the game world/player's state. It works really well.

this sounds really good until you remember we don’t know the one-way speed of light

the US should adopt the metric system but use its own version of the meter that is just *slightly* longer so that the speed of light is exactly 300mil m/s

1 imperial meter = 1.0006923 old meters

The scale of the AIDS crisis is hard to understand until you see the numbers.

For example, in 1990, 61% of the deaths of men aged 25–44 in San Francisco were due to AIDS.

By 1995, AIDS had killed every tenth gay man.

More on Ukraine’s 4 women-2 men delegation to IMO 2023:

1. Their top scorer is a woman, and, except for Ksenila Drosdova, all of the women scored higher than the men.

Now there's one way to increase women representation in the IMO, just... not sure it will scale  twitter.com/MarcosVaena/st…

and yes I know about Polgar

But this is a very interesting topic and I want to learn more.

Lastly I want to see if all the conditions can be replicated somehow.

Now there's one way to increase women representation in the IMO, just... not sure it will scale
------
Of the top 20 countries, only one had women representation in the Math Olympiad. I’m sure math talent is not gender-specific, so it would be nice to see the organizers promote more of the Math Olympiads amongst young women and girls. The future STEM professionals will thank them!

TIL via @mechanicaldirk: your @PyTorch random seed is probably too small. 

"It is recommended to set a large seed, i.e. a number that has a good balance of 0 and 1 bits. Avoid having many 0 bits in the seed." (https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.Generator.html#torch.Generator.manual_seed…)

not the best design...

I'm giving lessons on game theory this week and today I'll discuss Braess's paradox: the bizarre result that building roads can sometimes *worsen* traffic.  In the pic, n=4000 drivers.
