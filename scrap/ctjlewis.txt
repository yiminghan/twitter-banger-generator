"LLMs will fade like self-driving cars" is a weird prediction to make specifically this week

It will cause some moderate scandal with substantial harms, but lawsuits will be settled in favour of openai. Public opinion will sour, pricing will become prohibitive and/or the experience full of ads, and the use of LLMs will fade like self-driving cars, Facebook, or GANs (2/2)

"prompt engineering"? oh you mean writing

The fight will be managed by my and Zuck’s foundations (not UFC).

Livestream will be on this platform and Meta. Everything in camera frame will be ancient Rome, so nothing modern at all.

the Figma-React translation work is, and always has been, fully automatable. but it has not been solved still, very hard problem. venture has put up money at least 3x, so rare case where they’re not to blame even.

no amount of ai augmentation will remove humans from art. a baby could draw a clumsy circle on a piece of paper and it would stir our hearts. a discord bot trained on all human art can draw stunning fantasy vistas and we're like cool seen that before

Genuine q: why does academic writing thrive on obscure words? Is it an ingroup arcanity pissing contest, a Bene Gesserit Pain Box that filters out those too weak to wield powerful knowledge, or simply because that’s the best way to convey the content?

Here is one final, truly spectacular twist. 

Apatite, the main constituent of #LK99, is often mistaken for other minerals. In fact, it was named for this property. 

In Greek, ἀπατάω means “to deceive.”

The end!

It's as close to official as we'll probably get: LK-99 is likely simply a ferromagnetic material, which explains its levitating properties, according to new research from Peking University. 

The room temperature superconductivity revolution will have to wait another day.

So far, when it comes to LK-99, everyone is behaving like the cliché:

China: a bunch of university labs worked to replicate as fast as possible

US: a private company sponsored a replication as a marketing gimmick

Russia: cat girl, but whole thing is unclear

Europe: on holiday

Growing up in Germany you're taught that nuclear energy is terrible. Yet, all my scientific friends agree that it is by far the cleanest form of energy - it is SO much better for the planet than coal/fossil fuels... I wonder if the green party/politicians can course correct?

science is accelerating, anon.

LK-99 Replication Vlog (August 3rd, 2023)

Insane that 
@andrewmccalip
 
@zebulgar
 & team pulled this off so quickly.

Clearly yields need to improve dramatically for more testing (you'll see them attempt a heating test in the video).

Excited for more experimentation here!

When I talk to startups more than a year or two old, it's remarkable how consistently the biggest source of problems is not competitors but their own employees and investors. Dealing with competitors is easy compared to dealing with the people who are supposed to be helping them.

So I know quite a few labs in the US who are working on it but are being intentionally more cautious (need to verify results, repeatability, better analysis of the actual structure, etc). I'd guess you'll hear a lot more results, which are a lot more thorough than what's been on

It is true is that most PIs did not divert all of their effort. I put only one of mine on it, addressing an important question related to structure. Precisely zero people in my department know about that. There is no timeline that offsets the cost of publishing bad data.

This is absolutely not the case. Reputable US labs take care and time working up their samples, characterizing their composition, and measuring their properties. American science is rigorous and thorough. Sit tight - we do not need more random videos and rushed preprints #lk99

Result 1: Cu on the Pb(1) site causes a volume collapse. This is not especially exciting but was consistent with the experiment. However, what was particularly interesting to me was that the Cu substitution caused the whole crystal structure to collectively distort

 finds a theoretical basis for superconductivity in Cu-doped Lead Apatite. 

Isolated flat bands at the Fermi level is a hallmark of superconducting crystals. LK99 has it!!!!

This is huge

man: thank you God for giving us computers to do the hard thinking for us

god: of course my child, this is what I always intended. that’s why I made them so easy to make with just lead and copper

man: …you mean silicon right?

What I have been repeating, there is no way in hell that experts working on a superconductor for years didn't measure this thing over and over again. It was either fraud or the real deal, if u wanna scam ppl u don't make the manufacturing so easy that any anime girl can do it
------
Look. I have no slightest intention of doubting that the material is superconducting. It's probably the one thing they checked themselves 100500 times.
But making the prep and synthesis not a mess?
You fear changing it, because you don't want to lose ot if you are attached.

Here's a chunk of pyrolytic graphite on the same magnet with the same stick. Even with less density and more surface normal to field.... It doesn't lift off.
If it's diamagnetism it's a fucking absurdly strong one

They obtain lanarkite through baking PbO and PbSO4 which is insane. Lanarkite is a primary precipitate in aqueous solutions outside of "concentrated sulphuric acid" acidity. Here I used 1/100 of my solutions (i. e. 1/10000 of product)

they’re demanding we pay an invoice in full that far exceeds the actual net balance on the account bc they refuse to count our Founders Hub credits against it. 

the credits were issued before the invoice was issued, but they claim they only apply from this month onward.

in the meantime, i dispute that we owe them the amount on this invoice and accordingly refuse to pay it.

Does Meta even count as a rebrand? I've seen comparisons. But like a day to day user of any $META products would have no idea that anything had changed if they didn't read the news. It's still FB, Insta etc.

I hit a bug in the Attention formula that’s been overlooked for 8+ years. All Transformer models (GPT, LLaMA, etc) are affected.

Researchers isolated the bug last month – but they missed a simple solution…

its not solved to be clear

we have very intelligent people on this problem rn

great, so here was the mystery: it WAS related to the matrix shape, however it was not actually because of the resampling. the resampling was correct.

Wow. @Meta commits to dedicate three engineer-years to implement the removal of the GIL from #Python and fix upcoming compatibility and performance issues with it.

All this dependent on whether the Steering Council accepts PEP 703.

Zuck is now up to 93m 

He's going to get to 100m today - demolishing ChatGPT's record and making his app the fastest adopted consumer product in history

i believe Zuck is actually creating demand that was not there before, as opposed to filling existing demand

there were several attempts at this which didn’t convert remotely as well. but our guy built this system, he simply pulls levers and it behaves for him
