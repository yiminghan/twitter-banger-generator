Not at all! I just think it's complete hubris to think you can control the future 500 years from now.

To celebrate 100,000 followers I’ll blow up the universe I think

------
My reality is better than your reality. I experience deeper than you. I feel more avant-garde emotion in a day than you’ll feel in your life. You’re in a foggy dream while I’m awake.
